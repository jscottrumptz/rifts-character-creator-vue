Can also be used to heal a character who has suffered so much damage that he or she has lapsed into a coma (zero Hit Points or less). Psychic Surgery is the equivalent or '"professional hospital'' treatment. The recovery from a coma (near death) is equal to treatment from a hospital, 1-66%. Note that there is minimal bleeding and pain, and absolutely no scarring from Psychic Surgery (no pain if the Deaden Pain ability is used).`;
