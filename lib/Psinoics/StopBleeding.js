This means stopping additional damage from blood loss and being able to function relatively unimpaired. As impressive and potentially lifesaving as this ability may be, it is only a stopgap measure. The injury is NOT being healed and the characterÂ· still needs medical attention or he will, eventually, die from his injuries. If rendered unconscious, the bleeding and blood loss damage immediately begins.`;
