The strongest emotions are easiest to sense; hate, anger, terror, love. Feeling for emotions can often be used to establish that somebody or something is nearby, but can NOT be used to pinpoint an invisible or hiding per-son/ creature. Empathy can be especially helpful in recognizing and communicating with ghosts and other supernatural creatures.\n    Questioning a person/being while using Empathy can be very handy in establishing how they are reacting to you. In a limited sense, Empathy can be used like a lie detector to see if the emotions match the verbal response. For Example: \"Did you know the deceased')\" The verbal answer is no, but there is a sudden flare of nervousness and fear (or hate). This doesn't mean the guy is the killer, but it might mean he is lying about knowing the dead man. Further questions might pull out a strong emotion such as anger or hate (or happiness), which may con-firm the psychic's suspicions that this man might be involved in the murder. However, remember that this is, at best, circumstantial evidence and definitely inadmissible in court. Physical proof must be found, hut the empathic readings may put characters on the right track. Also, remember that the empathic psychic is feeling the person's real emotions, hut interpreting their significance. A very nervous person may always radiate fear or anxiety, while a cold-blooded, pathological killer may feel nothing at all and stay calm and cool as he lies through his teeth. The feeling of hate may mean that the person did know the murder victim, or knew of him, and hated him for any number of rea-sons. That does not mean he killed him. As you can sec, interpreting emotions can be a tricky thing. \n    Haunting Ghosts and Entities rarely mask their emotions. Thus, the psychic can easily tell if one or more is nearby (within 100 feet/30.5 m) and what it is feeling, “I sense great sorrow.\" or \"Do as it says! It is angry, almost crazed. I think it will carry out its threat if you try to stop it.\"\n`;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Empathy;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/CombatCyborg.7b179909.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/BodyFixer.020ba1e4.jpg\";","const Psionic = require('../Psionic');\n\nclass SummonInnerStrength extends Psionic {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.name = 'Summon Inner Strength';\n        this.group = 'Physical';\n        this.range = 'Self.';\n        this.duration = '10 minutes per level of experience.';\n        this.cost = '4 I.S.P.';\n        this.description = `    This psi-power enables the character to draw on his inner reserves of strength to ward off pain and fatigue. \n\nEvery time the psychic calls upon his Inner Strength the following bonuses apply:\n• Add+ 1O S.D.C. \n• Add + 2 to save vs poison or toxins.\n• Add +5% to save vs coma/death.\n• Fatigue is temporarily forgotten and the character can function as if he was fully rested for the full duration of the Summon Inner Strength power.`;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = SummonInnerStrength;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/GlitterBoy.671cb6d7.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/CyberDoc.bf988d04.jpg\";","export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./Attributes.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=388aee3a&scoped=true&lang=css&\"","const Psionic = require('../Psionic');\n\nclass Exorcism extends Psionic {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.name = 'Exorcism';\n        this.group = 'Healing';\n        this.range = 'Immediate area, touch or within 8 feet (2.4 m).';\n        this.duration = 'Instant, if successful.';\n        this.cost = '10 I.S.P.';\n        this.lengthOfTrance = '30 minutes of preparation and 6D6 minutes with the possessed person or animal.'\n        this.description = `    The healer can perform a Rite of Exorcism that uses psychic energy to expel the loathsome being from its mortal, host body.

Sometimes it works (if the roll is under the base skill) and sometimes it does not (when the roll is above the base skill). A failed roll means the psychic received no insight to the future. \n    A clairvoyant trance can be attempted as often as twice every day. The message can be a sudden feeling that somebody is in need ('\" ... something's wrong. lt's ... it's .. .Janet! I've got to see her!\") or, more often, a sudden flash of insight, a sudden image that races through the mind. The image is like a brief snippet of film from a movie or a dream. Often all the details are not clear, but the potential danger is. For example, \"The psychic character is in a trance or meditation, thinking about his/her friend Janet. Suddenly, the mind is flooded with an image of Janet rushing down a crowded street. It's dusky, like morning, twilight or evening. She seems very upset. The traffic light changes to amber. Janet races into the street, ignoring the light. It turns red. There's a car, squeal of tires, Janet screams. The image ends.\" ls Janet hurt? Killed? Unknown, but the danger is clear. There are also other hints of information: the time of day, Janet seeming upset, rushing, etc. The glimpse into the future could be twenty minutes, eight hours, 24 hours, or a week. The psychic has no way of knowing. Of course, he has the advantage of recognizing the potential danger as it begins to un-fold and may be able to avoid it, stop it or change the outcome. The im-age may last a few minutes or be a sudden flash lasting but a few seconds. The flash could be a peculiar noise, a face, or a specific image, like a particular door or object.\n    It is important to note that sometimes a clairvoyant image will occur unintentionally, without the psychic trying to do so. These most often manifest themselves as dreams or nightmares during sleep. The clairvoyant dream is exactly like the image from a meditative trance de-scribed previously. The precognitive flash of the future may also occur un-beckoned while awake, but this is extremely rare. These brief glimpses of the possible future happen because the clairvoyant is acutely attuned to his world. Anything that might hurt or change that world (including people and places) will often be foretold in a flash of insight. \n`;\n        this.gmNote = `    Be careful of revealing too much.

This power is limited to the acquisition or reading of information only. The psychic cannot input, program, or delete data on the machine. He can also access information stored by most electronic means, including computer disks, video and audio disks, film or audio tape, and hard drives. Reading electronically encoded disks and tapes is similar to Object Read, except in this case, he hears and sees the data as if he were playing it on a computer or disk player, only he perceives the information IO times faster. Thus, the character can read (never input) information from disks or broken computers without a physical \"jack\" connection or an actual display device, i.e. computer and monitor, CD player, etc. \n    As an actual Machine Ghost, the psychic mentally enters and travels the neural network of an active computer. He is actually inside the de-vice. In many ways, this experience is similar to Astral Projection except the psychic is \"projecting\" into the machine rather than into the Astral Plane. It also has the same pitfalls as Astral Projection, as in the character enters a strange, very seemingly real world that he must learn to navigate. Like Astral Projection, the electronic world of computers takes on a virtual world landscape. This means in the computer virtual world, its programs, viruses and defense mechanisms will take on virtual manifestations that can interact, confront, impede, or attack the Machine Ghost. \n    A password or special access code may appear as a metal door or iron gate, or locked filing cabinet that needs to be (seemingly) broken open to gain access to what is held inside. The more difficult the code, the bigger, stronger and more difficult the door and lock(s). Data is likely to appear as books, paper files, diagrams, film, holograms, and other common means of communication and documentation. The more sophisticated defense measures are likely to appear as one or more guards who must be defeated before the information is accessible. They can appear as sorcerers, Coalition troops, known enemies or exotic aliens. Viruses and defenses designed to attack an intruder typically appear as demons or monsters. \n    Combat in the virtual world seems real and is conducted the same as it would happen in the real world. Combat and damage are measured by the character's perception of his real body armor, weapons and natural powers. When the psychic has lost more than 70% of his armor, or S.D.C./M.D.C., he will feel the urge to flee the virtual world. If he flees, a computer defender will not follow, however a virus will pursue and continue to fight. Although all such damage is only in the mind of the psychic (no physical damage occurs in the real world), if he dies in the virtual world, he can die in the real world as well! The shock to his psyche and body will momentarily stop his heart, and he slumps over dead! The character must roll to save vs coma and death. In this case, physical treatment is not necessary and the recovery process, if successful, takes less than a minute. The psychic must roll three times, and the best two out of three rolls determines life or death. Rolling between 01-75%, two out of three times, means the heart starts and the character is shaken but fine; feels woozy for 204 minutes (reduce Spd 25% and all combat bonuses by half). Failure to recover from the heart attack means immediate CPR medical treatment is required - Paramedic skill will suffice, provided any protective body armor can be removed so that treatment can be given; rescuers have IO minutes. Roll to save vs coma and death again; must roll twice under 80% out of three rolls. \n    The downside in the usage of this power is the psychic loses all sense of time and reality outside the data he is accessing. This means he is oblivious to what is happening around him, and unless protected by a companion, is vulnerable to attack without any means of defense. Pain or being struck or shaken will alert the psychic to trouble, but he has the choice of breaking contact and responding, or ignoring it and continuing to retrieve data. Only Telepathy can reach the character while in this state (can't hear spoken words or sounds outside the computer), and is a means of two-way communication. \n    A character accessing a file on a disk can break contact at any time with a thought. although he will be disoriented for one melee round; re-duce his number of attacks and combat bonuses by half. Breaking free of a computer virtual world is not so easy. \n    Unfortunately, leaving the virtual world of a computer is fundamentally the same as the Astral Plane. The psychic can vaguely sense the way he came and must follow it hack to the virtual access point. To do so. the player must roll on the following table and must roll \"definitely certain\" to have his character successfully escape. The player must keep trying until he succeeds or time elapses. If the character cannot es-cape virtual space before the duration of this ability elapses, he is flung out with the same effect as \"virtual death\"; roll to save vs coma and death as described above.`;\n        this.note = `The psychic will instinctively know when he's down to the last three minutes of the duration and when trying to exit, can fly toward the way out (typically appears as a door or a dimensional Rift).\n    01%-30%: Hopelessly lost (roll again). \n    31%-45%: Uncertain (roll again). \n    46%-65%: Fairly certain on the right track (roll again). 66%-00%: Definitely certain!

They lack any sort of natural \"powers.\" They have no inherent mystical or psychic ability, no Mega-Damage skin nor Supernatural Strength. They are not predisposed to any skilled profession or area of study. Even their appearance is decidedly average, mirroring that of the native humans with the exception of their ashen gray skin and small, lidless, all-black eyes. Thus, Dram ins blend in seamlessly to the backdrop of the world. \n\n    In cultural and societal aspects, however, they are extremely alien. Try to imagine that you are the only being that really, truly exists in the whole world. Everything you see and touch -the rocks, the plants, the air, the animals, and the people - are all complex illusions. The world and the entire Megaverse are massive constructs built around you. Everything exists as some sort of game, trial, or test for you to complete as best you can. \n\n    As bizarre as it sounds, this is the way that virtually every in-dividual Dramin views the world and his place in it. It is a deeply-ingrained perspective encoded into their being to which 99% of the race prescribes. It isn't an organized faith or social order, but each individual Dramin takes it upon him or herself to find the best path on the way to the end goal, whatever that may be. To outsiders, this seems terribly complicated and illogical, but to a Dramin it's simple. Each person takes his own view of things, but the choices to be made are the same: What am I meant to do? What is my ultimate purpose? How do I best achieve it? \n\n    Many choose to view the world from a spiritual perspective and believe that everything was created by an all-powerful being. These Dramins believe that they are being observed to see whether or not they are worthy for the real world, another stage of existence, or even for the afterlife. For most of these Dramins, their god is a nameless being to whom they alone answer, but some find the truths they are seeking in one established religion or another, usually in a god who promotes good over evil and rewards good works and acts of charity. Most of these individuals strive to help others, fight injustice, or achieve enlightenment through study and prayer. They become healers, teachers, and champions. Many find callings as lawmen, clerics, or modem knights-errant, challenging evil in all of its forms in the hopes of doing good in the eyes of their god. \n\n    Other Dramins take a scientific view of the situation, and believe that they are little more than the subject of an experiment or an expansive simulation. They may see themselves as rats trying to make it to the reward in the center of a maze, or as students taking the mother of all examinations. Dram ins with this world-view tend to be problem-solvers, tackling challenges to cure a disease or build a better mousetrap. They gravitate toward technical and scientific professions, and are often students for life. Their studies may prompt them to travel across and be-tween worlds to seek knowledge or find the challenge that will define life and get them to the end of their test. \n\n    Others take a carefree attitude toward life and live \"in the moment.\" They live to eat, drink, and be merry without a second thought for what tomorrow may bring. They relieve themselves of the cares and responsibilities of the world; nothing that they do makes a difference anyway, right? Many of these Dramins become terrible oppressors, despots, power-mongers or party animals who seek to satisfy their own whims and desires with-out regard for others.

This psychic inner self is the Astral Body, a whitish, transparent, ghostly image of the character's physical form. A long silver thread or cord connects the Astral Body with its physical self. If the cord is severed the character is likely to die of sudden shock as body and soul are torn asunder. There is only a 30% chance the Astral Self can locate its physical body without the silver umbilical cord (roll best 2 out of 3). \n    The physical body lapses into a coma-like trance when the Astral Self has left it. In this state the body is completely helpless. It cannot walk, move or think; completely catatonic. \n    The hazards are threefold. First, if the physical body is killed, the Astral Body is forever lost and will die, fade away, within six hours. Second, if the Astral Body gets lost or captured while in the Astral Plane. the body will begin to waste away and die. (Note: One minute of our time is equal to one week in the Astral Plane.) Third, the Astral Body is vulnerable to psychic attacks and attacks from ghosts, entities and creatures of the Astral Plane. \n    There are two levels of Astral Projection, coexistence (physical body and spirit form) in the material world and/or the Astral Plane (another dimension). Astral Projection from the physical body into the material world creates a ghostly specter of the Astral Self which can be seen only by other psychics, young children under 13 years old, animals and most supernatural creatures. While in Astral Form the character automatically gains the ability to float, fly (mach one/670 mph/1072 km maximum), see the invisible, pass through solid objects (including M DC walls), impervious to physical harm (including cold, heat and energy). are invisible to sensor systems and cameras, and see and hear as usual. The Astral Body cannot communicate with the physical world except through Telepathy or Empathy, nor speak to, smell or touch anything on the Material Plane. The Astral Self is little more than a mute, ghostly observer. Of course, this is a great way to locate invisible supernatural entities, as well as spy on other humans on the Mate-rial Plane (although limited by short sprints. See duration). A character traveling the Material Plane via Astral Projection may use any psionic powers that do NOT require physical contact. They can generally only affect the physical world (or themselves be affected from physical beings) by Sensitive psionic powers such as Telepathy, Clairvoyance, Empathy, etc.; Astral travelers communicate using Telepathy. \n    Traveling in Astral Form has its own very special dangers. While the character can see the invisible and other Astral Travelers, they can also see him. This makes him susceptible to their psychic and Astral Form attacks, for two Astral Travelers can lock into hand to hand combat as well. The most vulnerable target is the silver cord which is the Astral Traveler's lifeline to the physical world. Fortunately, the cord has an Astral S.D.C. which is two times that of the person's physical Hit Points and S.D.C. combined. The thread-like silver cord is a difficult target to hit; attackers are -6 to strike. The Astral Body also has an S.D.C. of two times the Hit Points and S.D.C. of the physical body combined. This means if the character has 18 Hit Points and 28 S.D.C. both the Astral Body and its silver cord have 92 Astral S.D.C. each (18 + 28 = 46 x 2 = 92 each). Remember, magic and psychic influence have full effect on the Astral Body. This includes exorcism, which will force the Astral Traveler to leave the immediate area (400 foot/122 m radius) and not return for 24 hours. The Astral Traveler has the same number of attacks per melee, bonuses, hand to hand, skills, knowledge and psychic powers that he or she has in the Material Plane.\n\n    Entering the Astral Plane is like entering the Twilight Zone. After a minute of concentration the Astral Gateway appears as a bright patch of shimmering, white light. Once the Astral Traveler passes through it, he will find himself in an endless expanse of white light, and rolling, white clouds. There is no up or down, no bottom or top; no north or south, no land or air or sea, just endless, slowly swirling white. Time, too, is a different or altered state, for what would seem to be a week in the Astral Plane is barely one minute in the physical world. That means a 2nd level Mind Melter could spend the equivalent of ten weeks in the Astral Plane and, when he returned to his physical body, he would find that only ten minutes of real time had elapsed. Although time may flow differently between the Astral Plane and the real world, the Astral Traveler is still subject to the laws of the real world when he returns. If he was low on I.S.P. when he entered the Astral Plane, even if he was there for several weeks of Astral Time, he would still be low on I.S.P. when he returns to the real world. Time and space twisted and distorted, the Astral Traveler can travel from one end of our planet to the other, in the blink of an eye, by hopping through the Astral Plane. However, if he does not know where he is going, he could end up hopelessly lost in the Astral Plane somewhere. Furthermore, the Astral Plane has its dangers as well, from Astral Beings and monsters to be-coming endlessly lost. Even if all goes well, the distortion of place and time makes it extremely difficult to find the material world and one's dormant, physical body. Even trying to follow the silver cord can lead to nowhere.\n\n    To return from the Astral Plane to the physical body, roll on the following table: Each roll will determine the Astral Traveler's state of mind and sense of direction. The percentile dice can be rolled up to three times per melee (15 seconds). The player must roll \"definitely certain\" to successfully return. The player may keep trying until he succeeds or time elapses. \n\nLocation of the Physical Body \nRoll Percentile Dice to Return from the Astral Plane:\n01%-30%: Hopelessly Lost (roll again). \n31%-50%: Uncertain, Confused (roll again). \n51%-76%: Fairly certain of location; on the right track (roll again). \n77%-00%: Definitely certain of location. (Whew! Made it Back).\n\n    Astral travel with a partner is a much safer way to travel, because if one can find his body, he can lead the other one out with him.`;\n        this.note = `Traveling on the Material Plane in Astral Form is infinitely easier than the Astral Plane. To find the physical body the character need only return to where he left it. If it has been moved or hidden the Astral Self can sense its location with a 60% efficiency (roll once per melee). \n    The other danger lies in being attacked by other beings in the Astral Plane. Entities and elemental creatures of magic live in the Astral Plane or travel through it. These beings are usually hostile, evil forces. While the Astral Body cannot touch or communicate with the material world, the Astral Body is quite solid to other inhabitants of the Astral Plane. The Astral Body is also vulnerable to magic and psychic powers, as well as physical assault by Astral Entities. \n    The energy which composes the Astral Plane is responsive to thoughts and desires. The strongest Astral Beings can mentally or magically control what a small area might look like. This means that the Astral Plane is made up of hundreds or perhaps thousands or even millions of tiny Astral \"Kingdoms\" adrift within the vast whiteness. Exactly what these kingdoms look like is up to the entity that creates it. Some may look like a modern city, others like castles or forests, while still others, a frightening landscape. Perhaps this is where legends of visitations to Heaven and Hell originate?

This is done by holding the object and concentrating on a specific line of thought or opening up to general impressions (the latter is always more vague and random). Just as a psychic must open himself to sense evil or magic, he must open himself to the object. If successful, he will receive impressions and/or images revealing bits of information. \n\nImpressions include: \n    General alignment of its last owner (good, selfish, evil), general emotional state of mind (angry, happy, sad, hate filled, confused, etc.), the object's general purpose (what it is used for), whether or not the last owner is living or dead, and whether the item has been used with/by magic or supernatural forces. Object Read will also conclusively indicate whether the item is currently enchanted or contains a supernatural force/entity (as well as its alignment and emotions). If the item is possessed, an Object Read makes the reader totally vulnerable to psychic attack (no bonuses to save). \n\nImages: \n    The psychic can also see images of isolated events which have happened in the past. This will provide brief snippets of images and events that will offer glances of the previous owner and others close to him. Traumatic and emotion filled events/images are the easiest to see. Impressions will accompany the images, adding to the story as it unfolds. Information includes: approximate age, height, weight, build, race, sex, sometimes occupation, hair color and length; special facial or body features such as a scar or tattoo or beard (very often the exact facial features are out of focus, blurred or obscured); the object's use/purpose; and some special event, usually very traumatic, important or happy. Often the event image will be fragmented as if it was a piece of movie film edited by a crazy man. The event will always be one in which the object was involved in some way. \n\nThe success or failure of an Object Read: \n    Roll percentile dice once for impressions and once for images. The roll must fall under the character's base skill ability to succeed. A roll higher than the base skill means a failure and the psychic feels and/or sees nothing. Impressions and images are two different things, so roll for each. The psychic may get no impressions, but see images or vice versa. The present cannot be seen unless the psychic was successful on at least one of the previous read impressions or images rolls. Once an object has been read it cannot be read again by the same psychic, even if he did not see or feel a thing. Of course. the psychic can attempt to Object Read other items, but each attempt will cost 6 I.S.P. \n\nThe Present:\n    The present can also be glimpsed, but costs an additional 4 I.S.P., with no guarantee of success. Sometimes the psychic can focus in to see and feel the last owner as he or she is at that very moment. This will provide an idea of what is his current state of mind/emotion, appearance, dress. general location (that is to say, a bedroom, office, street, outdoors. etc.; no address or sense of close or far is provided), general features (shaved his beard, dyed hair, etc.) and so on.

 this.group = 'Physical';\n        this.range = 'Up to 60 feet (18.3 m) away.';\n        this.duration = '2 minutes per level of experience.';\n        this.cost = 'Small: 3 I.S.P., medium: 8 I.S.P., large (over 20 lbs/9 kg): 8 I.S.P. + 1 I.S.P. per every 10 lbs (4.5 kg) of weight.';\n        this.description = `    Telekinesis is the ability to move objects without any other means than directed psychic energy. The character can make an object hop, fall, roll, rise into the air, suspend it there (hover) or make it fly across the room. \n    In order to move an object by Telekinesis, the item must be clearly visible, within the psychic's range (60 feet/18.3 m) and the point of focus. As usual, the psychic must concentrate on what he is doing; thus, each telekinetic feat counts as one of the character's physical attacks. The total number of telekinetic attacks is equal to the character's number of physical attacks per melee; usually 4 or 5. One can attack with Telekinesis by hurling an object as if thrown or causing it to buzz about a room, swinging and hitting like a club controlled by an invisible hand. Several objects can be telekinetically thrown around within the same melee round, but not simultaneously. The psychic can only concentrate on one item at a time. For example: A physical psychic with four, normal, hand to hand attacks per melee can perform four attacks with Telekinesis. First. he makes a flower vase fly from the table, aiming it at his opponent's head. Second, he makes the lamp hurl at the guard at the door. Third, the table is suddenly flipped up on end and, fourth. the doorknob is turned and the door flung open. Four attacks or actions using Telekinesis. \n    As we can sec in the example, Telekinesis can be used to do more than making objects fly around. The Telekinetic power can be used to open doors. flick switches, press buttons, turn knobs and dials, open windows. make a rocking chair rock and so on. The range of possibilities is extensive when you stop and think about it. Remember, each action counts as one of the character's physical actions/attacks per me lee. \n    It is easiest to move or hurl small objects weighing two pounds (0.9 kg or less) Maximum height or distance is 60 feet (18.3 m). Medium-sized objects weighing 3 to 20 pounds (1.35 to 9 kg) are more difficult to manipulate. Maximum height or distance is reduced by half; 30 feet (91 m) Large or heavy objects weighing over 20 lbs (9 kg) are the most difficult lo maneuver. reducing maximum height and distance to 15 feet (46 m) IS.P. cost for large. heavy objects is 8 I.S.P. for the first 20 lbs (9 kg) plus one I.S.P. for each additional 10 lbs (4.5 kg) of weight. This means it would cost 19 I.S.P. to move a 125 lb. (56.2 kg) weight (8 ISP. for the first 20 lbs (9 kg) +11 I.S.P. for the remaining 105 lbs). Remember. the height and distance of effect is limited to 15 feet (4 6 m) for such a heavy object. \n\nTelekinesis Combat Bonuses:\n• + 3 to strike with Telekinesis; physical/skill bonuses to strike do not apply when Telekinesis is used. \n• +4 to parry with Telekinesis by using a controlled object to parry or sheer telekinetic force to block an attack. Counts as a medium heavy object; costs 8 J.S.P. Note: Only these two bonuses apply to TK combat. \n• S.D.C Damage from Hurled Objects: \n    Very Small: 6 ounces to 1 pound (0.23 to 0.45 kg): 1D4. \n    Small: 1.5 to 2 lbs (0.6 to 0.9 kg): 1D6. \n    Medium Small: 2-4 lbs (0.9 to 1.8 kg): 2D4. \n    Medium: 5 to 10 lbs (2.25 to 4.5 kg): 3D4. \n    Medium Large: 11 to 25 lbs (4.95 to 11.2 kg) 3D6. \n    Large: 26 to 40 lbs (11.7 to 18 kg): 4D6. Add 1D6 damage for each additional 20 lbs (9 kg).`;\n        this.note = `This form of Telekinesis is not a force field, thus, while it can be used to parry/block a punch, kick, club, knife or even sword, it cannot stop bullets, arrows, gas, flying tackles, and similar attacks. Furthermore, a failed roll to make a telekinetic parry means the psychic did not parry and is struck by his opponent. \n    Telekinesis moves, lifts and throws physical objects with the power of the mind. so it may be used to hurl a victim into something as a slam attack but NOT as a crushing or thrusting attack in and of itself. Objects thrown would be equivalent to objects thrown by a physical hand. Telekinesis does not allow psychics to levitate themselves or fly, due to the weight limitation (see Super Telekinesis).`;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Telekinesis;","var render = function () {var

experience.';\n        this.duration = '4 minutes (16 melees) per level of experience.';\n        this.cost = '(Vapor): 6 I.S.P.  (Solid):12 I.S.P.';\n        this.description = `    This mystifying ability enables the psychic to create a slightly luminous, vapor-like substance that is exuded from the pores. Ectoplasm has two forms: an invisible vapor and a luminous, solid state. \n    The vapor is a sort of floating, probing finger that can snuff out candles, open doors, knock over or pick up small objects (weighing under 9 ounces/255 grams), tap somebody on the shoulder, rustle leaves and knock on a door. The Ectoplasmic vapor can be seen only by its creator, psychics and supernatural beings who can see the invisible, or with infrared optic systems (including infrared camera lenses, infrared gun sights, binoculars, etc.). Ectoplasm, although an invisible vapor, has physical properties, which means it cannot go through walls or solid objects. Thus, a person walking into an ectoplasm stream may feel a slight sensation, like walking into a spider's web or brushing against a cotton ball. Often a person will unwittingly walk into and snag the stream of floating ectoplasm, pulling or stretching it along without being aware of it. In such cases, the psychic must maneuver the snagged portion to loop around the human obstruction. The creator of the vapor can control the full length of the vaporous stream like a floating tentacle. Although the vapor cannot go through solid objects it can slip through keyholes, cracks under doors or loose seals around a window. If a breeze can blow through, so can ectoplasm. The only drawback is that the psychic must be able to see the ectoplasm to maneuver it. \n    The solid state of ectoplasm can be a startling sight. In this form the ectoplasm can be shaped into an extra limb, such as an arm and hand, or just a hand or tentacle, or even a foot attached to a long stream spooling out of the psychic. The Ectoplasmic limb appears as a white, slightly luminous appendage connected to a trail of ectoplasm stretching back to its creator like a life-line of silly putty. The appendage and its connecting line can hover, float, levitate and fly (at a speed of I 8). The solid ectoplasmic limb has much greater strength and is able to carry, lift or hold up to 40 lbs. (18 kg), but cannot squeeze through the tiny openings that the vapor can. An opening must be at least the size of a quarter for solid ectoplasm to fit, and then the limb must be turned into a thin tentacle and reformed on the other side of the opening. Ecto-plasm can also be used to create a face or even a full figure, although detailed features are impossible. Ectoplasmically created images may explain apparitions reported during some seances.\n\nEcto-Combat:\n    The ectoplasm vapor and solid form both have an automatic dodge against all attacks directed at any of its length. That means an attempt to hack the middle of the ectoplasmic stream will see that portion of the ectoplasm suddenly swerve, loop or bend with a life of its own to avoid the attack. The dodge by the mid-section (or any-where else) does not count as a melee action by the ecto-appendage. Moreover, the ectoplasm's creator can direct the appendage to hit back or pick up and use a weapon. The solid ectoplasm appendage is not a great tool for combat, however. It limits its creator's attacks/actions per melee and has minimal strength; equal to about a P.S. attribute of 4. A punch or kick does a mere one point of Hit Point/S.D.C. damage. Damage can be increased by the appendage using any type of hand-held weapon weighing under 40 lbs. (18 kg) and less than five feet (1.5 m) long. Small modern weapons, such as an energy pistol or revolver, can be used, but are -IO to strike. Meanwhile, the vapor cannot use any weapons weighing more than 9 ounces and can inflict no damage of its own. \n    A vapor or solid appendage must be controlled by its creator at all times (except the automatic dodge); thus, it has a number of attacks/actions equal to its creator. So, if the psychic has four attacks per melee, the ectoplasm appendage also has four attacks. However, each attack/ action by the ectoplasm counts as one of its creator's actions for that melee round.\n\nEcto-Combat Statistics:\n• Vapor and solid get an automatic dodge against all attacks, including multiple or simultaneous attacks.\n• +5 to dodge; applies to vapor and solid.\n• + 1 to parry; applies to vapor and solid. \n• + 1 to strike; applies to vapor and solid. \n• Vapor inflicts no physical damage, but can touch, tap or pick up and carry objects weighing 9 ounces or less. \n• Solid ectoplasm inflicts one point of damage in combat or by weapon. \n• Attacks or actions per melee are equal to its creator's. A pair of ectoplasmic limbs will divide the attack between the two equally. \n• Astral S.D.C. is 40 plus one Hit Point. Applies to vapor and solid. If the ectoplasm is destroyed the creator takes one Hit Point and I 0 S.D.C. points of physical damage.\n• Sunlight or bright artificial light (250 watts) reduces the range to half. \n• Maximum range possible for vapor and solid is 40 feet plus 5 feet per level of experience (12.2 m + 1.5 m per level). \n• One full melee (15 seconds) is required to create an ectoplasm vapor or solid appendage. Half a melee (7 seconds) is needed to with-draw/return ectoplasm into its creator.\n`;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Ectoplasm;","const Psionic = require('../Psionic');\n\nclass ImperviousToPoison extends Psionic {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.name = 'Impervious to Poison';\n        this.group = 'Physical';\n        this.range = 'Self.';\n        this.duration = '2 minutes (8 melees).';\n        this.cost = '4 I.S.P.';\n        this.description = `    The character can negate the full effects of poisons and toxic chemicals which he has ingested (eaten or drank) or introduced into the bloodstream, as long as he has advance knowledge of its deadly properties.

They are bipedal humanoids with a light reddish-tan skin, and a darker red (for males) or purple (for females) back and top portion of the head. The backs of their heads are rather gourd shaped, not unlike a squash or pumpkin, and dotted with tiny red spines. In addition to the color of their skin, the D'norr's devilish appearance comes from their red complexion accented by dark blue eyes, gnarled, pointed ears, and a pair of horns that protrude from the forehead. Four small spines run along the top of each eyebrow and males have 4-6 protruding from their chins. Female D'norr have breasts (they are mammals), a smaller frame and feminine shape. \n\n    Despite their name and demonic appearance, Devilmen are actually highly intelligent, thoughtful, and compassionate. Most study social behavior, philosophy, the arts, and scholastic pursuits. As a result, many find the sciences and the pursuit of magic to their liking. Moreover, they are much less aggressive than humans and prefer to find a peaceful resolution to problems. This makes these peace-loving D-Bees natural team players and trustworthy teachers, negotiators and diplomats. \n\n    The Devilmen thrive on social interaction, and accept most intelligent beings until they are proven unworthy of their trust. Rifts Earth is a social and cultural paradise for the D'norr, filled with scores of alien beings with whom they can share their knowledge, philosophies and ideas, as well as learn many new things themselves. They welcome new people and new ideas like hungry children seeking to satisfy a hunger they can never quite quell. Devilmen are especially aware and respectful of the customs and beliefs of other people, which has made them welcomed among Native Americans, Fennodi, Lyn-Srial, Psi-Stalkers, and even Simvan. Most D'norr detest violence and a third are devout pacifists who fight only to defend themselves or to protect the innocent, and even then only long enough to es-cape. This admirable sentiment and lifestyle has made the Devilmen known and respected by Cyber-Knights, the Justice Rangers, Tundra Rangers, and lawmen throughout the New West, as well as at Lazio and New Lazio.

They are usually versed in survival skills and proficient in a wide range of science, technical, mechanical and electrical skills. In many cases, they look more like your average Headhunter than a scientist. These men and women suffer from an insatiable lust for knowledge that drives them into the wastelands and wilderness, digging through ruins to unearth pre-Rifts artifacts and technology and trying to explain magic, the Rifts, time, dimensional travel, and rediscovering humankind's past. They explore the ruins of toppled cities and study the habits and physiology of creatures from the Rifts. \n        Far from the Coalition States, they are highly regarded as men of science and learning. They are a welcome and, sometimes, desperately needed addition to most adventurer groups, mercenary companies, and wilderness towns. Yet these rugged explorers of our future Earth are frequently feared by superstitious wilderness folk and by the average people of the CS. Coalition propaganda has painted these Rogues as mad scientists who care about science and knowledge above the safety of people. Reckless fools who toy with alien technology and flirt with disaster. Rumor has it that Rogue Scientists and Rogue Scholars cavort with all manner of alien beings, monsters, and worse. They also dare to enter forbidden places and hell-spawned dimensions where no god-fearing man would set foot. All propaganda from the Coalition States that fuels the flames of fear and superstition. The illiterate are constantly bombarded by talk, radio and video telecasts about insane or rebellious rogues who threatened the sanctity of the city or who support alien life over human. Reports frequently offer an inflammatory statement like, \"Only the demented mind of a Rogue Scientist (or Scholar) could have conceived of anything so diabolical.\" Or \"Several books were found among the assailant's possessions, obviously the source of his delusions.\" Or warnings like, \"Remember, these self-proclaimed men of science are liars and pawns of alien forces. Report any suspicious activity to the authorities at once! The life you save may be your own!\" \n        The Coalition intentionally paints a scary picture of the Rogue Scientist, because its leaders fear their knowledge. The Coalition knows all too well the power of pre-Rifts and alien technology, and a curious mind. They are concerned that if left unhampered, these scientists may disrupt CS society and affect the status quo. To the CS, these characters are indeed rogues who question everything they see and seek answers and truths the CS would rather not have revealed. Independent and strong in body and mind, these independent crusaders are not the sheep that typifies the average CS citizen. They are wolves among the sheep.
