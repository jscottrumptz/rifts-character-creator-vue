The ghost can speak, but only in a soft-spoken voice. He can not speak loudly or shout, but can howl and shriek, only no words can be spoken. This \"spirit\" essence is intangible and can not be hurt by physical attacks, energy blasts or weather conditions - they all pass harmlessly through it. Likewise, magic swords, TW weapons and most types of magic have no effect on the ghost. Only magic and psionics that affect the mind or emotions can have an impact on the ghost. Even then, neither magic nor psionics can pull the Ley Line Ghost from the line.\n    The ghost must use magic and/or psionics to touch or affect the physical world, however, total P.P.E. is limited to P.E. attribute +1 point per level of experience, and I.S.P. to M.E. attribute +l point per level. As a ghost the deceased can not draw upon the ley line energy, but his personal reserve regenerates completely every 24 hours. \n    The Ley Line Ghost is magically tied to the ley line where the individual died. He can walk along the ley line and any connecting lines, but can not leave that line by any means, not by teieportation nor by dimensional Rift. The character will remain linked to the Earth via that specific ley line for one day per level of experience. After that, the ghost vanishes and goes wherever mortal spirits go. During his time on Earth the ghost can talk, offer advice, give instructions, make warnings, say good-bye to those he cares about, or scare and trouble those he dislikes. \n    This spell is typically performed when the dying character's work is not yet finished or he needs to tell somebody something. Since the spirit is rooted to the ley line, the ghost usually seeks to enlist the aid of sympathetic strangers (like the player characters) to finish what must be done or to deliver a message. The spell may also be used as a way for the character to linger on Earth in order to say good-bye to loved ones or to extract revenge or to plague enemies for a few days more (again, probably by enlisting the aid of strangers through a stirring appeal or trickery). Practitioners of magic who are of good or aberrant alignment will not use this spell on others unless they are asked to do so by the dying individual, or the situation is so dire that it is a necessity (Le. \"Only Bob has the information we need.

If the creation of the force field is to parry an attack, the psionic must roll a successful parry to see if he was able to create the field before the attack strikes. A successful parry means the force field' beat the attacker's strike and it absorbs the damage. TK Force Fields parry incoming attacks (both energy and projectiles) sim-ply by being created before the attack arrives. Any parries with the Force Field are done with straight rolls (normal parry bonuses do not apply). Once created, they have neither bonuses or penalties, they sim-ply absorb the incoming damage. \n    The TK Force Field can be made so that it only encircles its creator, or as large an area as a 10 foot (3 m) diameter per level of experience, and can be created yards/meters away, but always within the line of vision. The smallest force field possible covers about a three foot area (0.9 m). The field is a Mega-Damage structure with 25 M.D.C. per level of experience. \n    Once one field is created, the psychic can create as many others as his I.S.P. will allow. All must be in the character's line of vision. The TK Force Field(s) will remain in place until all its M.D.C. is destroyed or its creator dispels it. If the psychic is rendered unconscious or killed, the force fields instantly vanish. However, the psychic can choose to leave the area with his force fields still in place. They will remain until the duration time limit expires. People may be able to move around in-side a force field, but the force field itself cannot be moved once it is in place. The TK Force Field is actually a force bubble and is airtight, with enough air inside for the duration of the field. \n    If attempting to cast a Force Field around an unwilling target, they would get the chance to dodge out before the force field made it completely around them, but only if they knew in advance that the entrapment attack was coming, and even then they'd be -6 to dodge. \n    For an attacker to get inside a force field he must destroy all of its M.D.C. and in so doing, destroy the field itself. Any weapon blasts, explosions and magical energy attacks, such as Call Lightning, Fire Ball, etc., will hit the Force Field, they cannot be made to appear inside the field. It will also stop area effect magic. For instance, a Carpet of Adhesion will adhere to the force field instead of the people inside, and a magic cloud may cover the sphere of force but it does not penetrate the protective field. However, Teleportation can be used to pop inside be-cause the mage can see his destination inside. Likewise, intangible spirits and Astral Beings can pass through force fields. Psionic mental attacks, Empathic Transmission and Bio-Manipulation can still be made to affect the minds of those inside the force field, provided the at-tacker has line of sight. Likewise, any psychic can use his psionic powers on those outside while he is inside the walls of the force field; line of sight. \n    Characters inside the force field suffer from the same limitations and cannot fire weapons or energy magic from within the force field \n    without hitting and damaging their protective bubble, and anyone caught inside a force field bubble is trapped inside until they blast their way out (destroying its M.D.C.) or the duration time elapses.`;\n        this.note = `A TK Force Field can NOT be used to suffocate someone by putting an airtight bubble around their head.

In the fortress cities modeled after Chi-Town, those who live in the lower levels of such a metropolis are generally nicknamed \"Downsiders,\" but \"City Rat\" is a designation for a Downsider troublemaker and the street urchins who run amok in the 'Burbs. They exist in most urban environments, but absolutely thrive in the ' Burbs and the lower levels, tunnels, and sewers of Chi-Town, Iron Heart and other mega-cities of the Coalition States, the New German Republic, Mexico and Japan. Most have never been beyond the city limits and have no desire to go adventuring beyond the urban sprawl. These are \"city people\" through and through. They know little about the outside world except what they read or hear on the street, and view it as wondrous, scary, and alien, but most of all, a place not for them. Their world is the rumbling and bustling city streets. Their secret havens, hideouts and lairs are the shadowy dark places that other city dwellers have forgotten about or fear to enter. \n    City Rats love the acrid mix of smells that is the living city: machine oil, vehicle exhaust, booze, and perspiration of the thronging multitudes. They are not afraid of the city's dark comers or its vermin. They know the back streets and, often, the alleys, sewer systems, and access tunnels in the belly of the beast that is the city. And they know them better than the average citizen knows the highways and avenues. \n    City Rats pride themselves on their knowledge of the streets and the movers and shakers who work them and the predators that prowl them. That means City Rats know where to find contraband, cybernetics, drugs, pawnshops, fences, Body-Chop-Shops, Black Market hangouts and hoods, the best food, the cheapest women, all night hot spots, and other places, resources and commodities on the streets. If you know where to look, you can find most anything you could need or want, and City Rats know all the ins and outs of their city. \n    The career of a City Rat is a way of life rather than an occupation. A lifestyle glamorized (and lived) as a sort of swashbuckling streetwise hacker and petty crook who travels the undercurrents of the city streets and the electronic super-highway with equal ease. It is a life of self-made intrigue, exploration, spying and thievery (of data if nothing else). City Rats are usually young men and women in their teens or twenties who walk on the wild side. They crave adventure and find it by bucking the system and dodging the law. A City Rat may be an idealistic rebel who seeks reform and justice in a corrupt and unjust society, or a simple thrill seeker who finds excitement and romance in the dark underbelly of the city and the subculture of the street scene. Many City Rats are computer hackers and information brokers, while others are little more than beggars and thieves, all surviving by the seat of their pants. The individual 's exact orientation and skills typically reflect his alignment, ideals, ethics, and goals.\n\n(see Rifts® Ultimate Edition pg. 88 for more information)`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/occ/CityRat.jpg';\n        this.raceDesc = `None, a third to half are D-Bees.`;\n        this.recommendedAttributes = `Generally the City Rat is fast, clever and agile, but there are no real requirements other than an I.Q. 10 or higher to be a hacker, P.P. of 10 or higher to be a thief, I.Q. 10 and P.P. 14 or higher to be an assassin, P.

Often all the details are not clear, but the potential danger is. For example, \"The psychic character is in a trance or meditation, thinking about his/her friend Janet. Suddenly, the mind is flooded with an image of Janet rushing down a crowded street. It's dusky, like morning, twilight or evening. She seems very upset. The traffic light changes to amber. Janet races into the street, ignoring the light. It turns red. There's a car, squeal of tires, Janet screams. The image ends.\" ls Janet hurt? Killed? Unknown, but the danger is clear. There are also other hints of information: the time of day, Janet seeming upset, rushing, etc. The glimpse into the future could be twenty minutes, eight hours, 24 hours, or a week. The psychic has no way of knowing. Of course, he has the advantage of recognizing the potential danger as it begins to un-fold and may be able to avoid it, stop it or change the outcome. The im-age may last a few minutes or be a sudden flash lasting but a few seconds. The flash could be a peculiar noise, a face, or a specific image, like a particular door or object.\n    It is important to note that sometimes a clairvoyant image will occur unintentionally, without the psychic trying to do so. These most often manifest themselves as dreams or nightmares during sleep. The clairvoyant dream is exactly like the image from a meditative trance de-scribed previously. The precognitive flash of the future may also occur un-beckoned while awake, but this is extremely rare.

[Example: a character with P.S. 9 could throw 45 lbs. (20kg) 9 feet (2.7m), a P.S. of 15 could throw 75lbs. (34kg) 15 feet (4.6m), or a P.S. 32 could throw 320lbs.

Robotic P.S. have triple the range (3ft./0.9m per P.S. point) and have the same penalties as awkward items.\n\nSupernatural P.S. of 17 or higher can throw half their maximum carrying weight (P.S. number x25) 5 feet (1.5m) per P.S. point [so a Supernatural P.S. of 24 can carry 1200lbs.

There are a few very special O.C.C.s that get the damage bonus for arrows and thrown weapons, but normally the damage bonus is only for melee combat.\n\nA thrown weapon is considered a ranged attack, however, the P.P. attribute bonus to strike does apply, and you can do an Aimed or Called Shot with thrown weapons. A thrown weapon can also be used to Disarm via an Aimed or Called shot (toss);bonuses to Disarm via Hand to Hand combat apply.\n\nA natural 19 or 20 does double damage. If the attack was an Aimed/Called Shot to Disarm, the attack is an automatic success. The only way for this attack to be parried or dodged by an opponent is for the defender to match or better the roll with their own natural, unmodified roll.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, each thrown items counts as one melee attack/action.

It was first developed by gunfighters and quickly adopted by the gunslingers and lawmen of the New West. This skill can be developed by any  of the Men at Arms O.C.C. but is fairly uncommon among most, except for the Gunfighter, Sheriff and Gunslinger.\n\nW.P. Sharpshooting must be selected for each weapon type or category of weapon (revolver, pistol, energy pistol, rifle, etc.) in which the Sharpshooting expertise is desired. This means if the character wants to be a specialist with revolvers, that's one Sharpshooting selection at the cost of two O.C.C. Related Skill selections, plus the W.P. selection (Sharpshooting can be applied to O.C.C. weapon skills but not Secondary Skills). If Sharpshooting is also desired for W.P. Energy Pistol, the skill must be selected again (at the cost of two O.C.C. Related Skills). This process is repeated for each W.P. for which the added benefits of Sharpshooting is desired. Since Sharpshooting selection costs the equivalent of two O.C.C. Related Skill selections, even most Gunslingers and Gunfighters seldom have more than one or two Sharpshooting specialties - most Men at Arms do not have any.\n\nAll bonuses and tricks are only possible with W.P.s to which the Sharpshooting skill has been added. Thus, a character with Sharpshooting: Revolver does not get the Sharpshooting bonuses when firing an energy pistol. The Sharpshooting skill can be added to all modern guns, from revolvers (six-shooters) to energy rifles, but does not include W.P. Heavy Military or W.P. Heavy M.D.; i.e. it can not be applied to rail guns, rocket launchers, mini-missile launchers, bazookas, artillery weapons, vehicle or robot weapons, hand grenades, or explosives. Likewise, Sharpshooting can not be applied to weapons that do not shoot, such as clubs, maces, knives,s swords, axes, whips, or even spears, bolas, or other weapons that can be thrown.\n\nThe Sharpshooting skill can be combined with the W.P. Archery skill, but is applicable only to the sling, crossbow, and bow and arrow. Only the Gunfighter, Sheriff, and Gunslinger O.C.C.s automatically get a few Sharpshooting skills among their O.C.C. skills, but any additional selections cost them two O.C.C. Related skills like anybody else. This skill is never available to robots, master psionics, practitioners of magic, dragons, demons, or any creatures of magic or supernatural beings.

Thus, if a character has four attacks per melee they can shoot FOUR aimed shots. This applies to all weapons. Roll to strike for each strike.\n\nShort Burst: +1 to strike. A burst is the shooting of several rounds, immediately one after another. Aim is more hasty and the recoil moves the weapon with each shot, reducing the accuracy. Semiautomatic/automatic weapons, machineguns, and sub-machineguns, are designed for burst firing. The concept if that, while accuracy is reduced, the odds of hitting one's target with multiple rounds is increased because more shots are fired. Roll to strike once to see if the entire burst hits.

Can be fired at one target only.\n\nLong Burst: +1 to strike. This burst fires 50% of the entire magazine (i.e. 30 round magazine uses 15 rounds in a long burst). Roll normal damage for one round then multiply by 3. Uses one attack/action. Can be fired at one target only.\n\nEntire Magazine Burst: Shooting off the entire magazine/clip within a melee round is possible. 100% of the rounds are fired. Roll normal damage for one round then multiply by 7. Uses up two attacks/actions that melee. Can be fired at only one target; machineguns (W.P.

You must fire a long burst or an entire magazine burst in order to spray. Shooting wild occurs when a trained character shoots without taking time to aim. This usuaully applies when the person is blinded, angry, running, rolling, leaping, shooting from a moving vehicle, etc. With the correct W.P.this mode of fire gains no bonus or penalty. Without the correct W.P. this mode of firing strikes at -6 penalty. Counts as two attacks/actions.

Damage is for one round only (a wild shot).\nSpray (to hit several targets simultaneously): roll once to determine if the target area is hit: 1D20; 5 or higher strikes as usual. Roll 1D4 to determine number of individual targets struck within that target area. However, each target gets a dodge to avoid getting shot.

This is done by holding the object and concentrating on a specific line of thought or opening up to general impressions (the latter is always more vague and random). Just as a psychic must open himself to sense evil or magic, he must open himself to the object. If successful, he will receive impressions and/or images revealing bits of information. \n\nImpressions include: \n    General alignment of its last owner (good, selfish, evil), general emotional state of mind (angry, happy, sad, hate filled, confused, etc.), the object's general purpose (what it is used for), whether or not the last owner is living or dead, and whether the item has been used with/by magic or supernatural forces. Object Read will also conclusively indicate whether the item is currently enchanted or contains a supernatural force/entity (as well as its alignment and emotions). If the item is possessed, an Object Read makes the reader totally vulnerable to psychic attack (no bonuses to save). \n\nImages: \n    The psychic can also see images of isolated events which have happened in the past. This will provide brief snippets of images and events that will offer glances of the previous owner and others close to him. Traumatic and emotion filled events/images are the easiest to see. Impressions will accompany the images, adding to the story as it unfolds. Information includes: approximate age, height, weight, build, race, sex, sometimes occupation, hair color and length; special facial or body features such as a scar or tattoo or beard (very often the exact facial features are out of focus, blurred or obscured); the object's use/purpose; and some special event, usually very traumatic, important or happy. Often the event image will be fragmented as if it was a piece of movie film edited by a crazy man. The event will always be one in which the object was involved in some way. \n\nThe success or failure of an Object Read: \n    Roll percentile dice once for impressions and once for images. The roll must fall under the character's base skill ability to succeed. A roll higher than the base skill means a failure and the psychic feels and/or sees nothing. Impressions and images are two different things, so roll for each. The psychic may get no impressions, but see images or vice versa. The present cannot be seen unless the psychic was successful on at least one of the previous read impressions or images rolls. Once an object has been read it cannot be read again by the same psychic, even if he did not see or feel a thing. Of course. the psychic can attempt to Object Read other items, but each attempt will cost 6 I.S.P. \n\nThe Present:\n    The present can also be glimpsed, but costs an additional 4 I.S.P., with no guarantee of success. Sometimes the psychic can focus in to see and feel the last owner as he or she is at that very moment. This will provide an idea of what is his current state of mind/emotion, appearance, dress. general location (that is to say, a bedroom, office, street, outdoors. etc.; no address or sense of close or far is provided), general features (shaved his beard, dyed hair, etc.) and so on.

It is used mainly to hold an item in mid-air, to bring an item from across the room without having to get up and get it, and to use magic energy to pick up, move, carry or hold one or more small objects. \n    The spell caster summons forth blue strands of magical energy that wrap around an item and bring it to him, hold it near or in place or still, or to pick up and carry it, following the mage around at waist or shoulder level. Being able to magically hold an item in mid-air until needed, or to magically carry or retrieve an item, allows the mage to keep his hands free to perform more delicate tasks. This also means the mystical movement of objects weighing less than to pounds (4.5 kg) is very simple and requires little concentration. When the mage is not consciously manipulating an object, the item hangs suspended 3-5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) above the ground, usually within arm's reach. \n    The P.P.E. cost varies with the combined weight of the objects, two P.P.E. points per five pounds (2.3 kg). \n    Inanimate objects get no save against this spell; this means that even tiny, lightweight robots get no save, although they may struggle or at-tack. \n\n    Limitations: \nMaximum speed of moving objects that weigh 10 lbs (4.5 kg) or less is a speed factor of I 0. Reduce speed by half when the total weight becomes I 00 lbs ( 45 kg) or more.\nMaximum height: Six feet (18 m). \nMaximum number of objects: Two per level of experience. Maximum weight: IO pounds ( 4.5 kg) per level of experience. The spell caster cannot manipulate more than his maximum weight, so a first level spell caster can manipulate up to two items with a combined weight of IO lbs ( 4.5 kg), while a third level mage can manipulate as many as six items weighing up to 30 lbs (13.5 kg). \n    \n    The magic force has the equivalent P.S. of 8, + 1 per additional level of the spell caster (9 at 2nd level, 10 at 3rd, etc.). \n    The magic energy is designed to hold and carry objects, so it can not be used to open a container, open a door or window, shoot a gun, pull a trigger or lever, press a button, or tum a knob, however, a small object can be \"manipulated\" to gently press or tap against a button or switch to turn it on or off. The spell caster must concentrate to direct the object and each action by the object counts as one of the character's melee actions. \n    Likewise, the slow speed of movement, relatively low P.S., and the fact that this spell is not intended for combat, means that small objects can NOT be hurled or used to stab or pound an opponent. Each object manipulated to hit/attack requires the conscious focus of the spell caster, uses up one of his attacks per melee, and is easy to dodge or parry (the magic force is -2 to strike, and no other combat bonuses apply).`;\n        this.note = `This magic cannot be used to pick pockets or steal items unnoticed.

Many are the tales of the Auto-G, but all are probably pure fiction or half-truths. They call themselves Earthlings and claim their natural appearance is \"human,\" however, an Auto-G is a shape-changer who can take the appearance and abilities of most mortal humanoids, which suggests they have nothing in common with humans. Some believe they are refugees and criminals from a far-flung galaxy not even known to the Splugorth, and call themselves \"human\" to hide among them and create confusion about their true nature. The Coalition States, Free Quebec, and even the Splugorth and other groups consider these strange beings to be the ultimate shape-changers without actually being a supernatural being or true creature of magic. \n    Unlike the metamorphosis of a dragon or the shape-changing abilities of other beings, the Auto-G's transformation is so complete that even its DNA and apparent natural abilities are the same as the race whose appearance it has assumed. This means if an Auto-G is copying a D-Bee race that has wings and flies, or can teleport, or tum invisible, etc., so can the Auto-G when he assumes that form. If killed while in its unnatural form, that's the way the body remains. It does not revert to its true, allegedly human appearance. \n    The ultimate shape-changer, an Auto-G can study and duplicate a specific individual right down to his or her fingerprints, retina, scent and unique genetic structure! Thus, an Auto-G disguised as someone else has identical fingerprints, voice and physical abilities, and can fool a retinal scanner, blood tests, voice pattern identification, and DNA tests! Even a spouse or the character's own mother can not tell the original from the genetic duplicate unless he acts differently and even then ... \n    The Auto-Gs' amazing powers of transformation place them among the very best and most dangerous spies, assassins, infiltrators and undercover agents in the Megaverse, and the absolute masters at framing innocent people. For this reason they are also among the most feared, hated and hunted. Even the Splugorth have instructed their minions to kill an Auto-G on sight. If someone is suspected of being an Auto-G, but can't be proven as such, they are still destroyed by Minions who are instructed that it is better to be safe than sorry. \n    Of course, an Auto-G does not possess the power to copy a person's skills, memories, habits, or personality, but these things can be studied and mimicked as part of a careful impersonation. Nor can they generate bionic implants or artificial appendages, only the actual, physical form of the subject they hope to imitate. These are the flaws in the Auto-G's disguise, but its odd behavior is hardly conclusive and might be explained away by drunkenness, drug use, illness, injury, magic, psionic influence, panic, confusion, or a lapse in memory. The physical disguise is so convincing, most people will find an answer to odd behavior rather than jump to the conclusion he has been replaced by a shape-changer.\n    Psionic powers can also help uncover an Auto-G, however, these beings pass casual inspection by Dog Boys, Psi-Stalkers and other psychics with ease. Since they are whatever race they are impersonating they do NOT register as anything else. Furthermore, an Auto-G can also disguise its P.P.E. and alter its aura. A Telepathic scan may pluck out an incriminating or disturbing surface thought, but only an interrogation and pointed questions are likely to produce thoughts that might betray the impostor, a casual scan of surface thoughts rarely reveals any-thing suspicious or incriminating. \n    A psychic Mind Bond always reveals the truth, but most psychics avoid using this invasive and distasteful power. Mean-while, using a See Aura is likely to display a very normal looking aura for that race. Unless the psychic has studied the aura of a specific person before he was impersonated by an Auto-G, the psychic will not see anything unusual or different. However, if the psychic is very familiar with the real McCoy's aura (typically a friend, loved one or somebody important), he is likely to notice subtle and disturbing differences or aberrations - one of which is a high amount of P.P.E. However, whether these differences from what he remembers are enough to make him suspicious is another matter entirely. \n    Auto-Gs are so incredibly rare and many of the stories about them are so outlandish and frightening, that most people do not believe they are real. In fact, there is only a 01-05% chance that an average person has ever heard of an Auto-G, and even among learned scholars, scientists, adventurers, warriors and practitioners of magic who have heard of the D-Bee, only O 1-15% believe they are real. The rest believe Auto-Gs are mythical boogeymen who never really existed except in stories from the Dark Age. The Coalition States, Splugorth and Naruni are the exception. \n    In the Coalition States, NTSET, Intel Specters, Psi-Net and top military and political leaders know Auto-Gs are real. The CS was among the first to discover that Auto-Gs exist, dating back to the early days of the Chi-Town City-State when these boogeymen were found living among them. This prompted the, even then, technological society to study and understand these strange, secretive beings. Having had more dealings with Auto-Gs than anyone else in the world, Chi-Town is the leading expert on the subject. They have established protocols for detecting and countering Auto-Gs that have stood the test of time for over one hundred years. When the Coalition States were formed they shared this information with their allied States, insisting that all other member States put their protocols in place (including Free Quebec). This information has always been kept \"Top Secret.\" Thus, the CS can identify Auto-Gs by testing for a particular rare combination of enzymes only the D-Bee possesses. They also use observational techniques and psionics to pinpoint individuals who might be Auto-Gs. The simple test can be performed on the living or dead and takes only a few minutes. The CS also has psionic procedures that can be used to help uncover \"suspected\" Auto-G infiltrators. Unfortunately, such detection in the 'Burbs and on the battlefield is much more difficult and rarely performed (it's just not practical). \n    In 2 P.A., Chi-Town launched a campaign to unearth and obliterate all shape-changers within their territories, with Auto-Gs at the top of the extermination list. This campaign is believed to have been so successful over the decades that it was believed Auto-Gs may have been wiped out. Whatever tiny numbers may have survived had certainly fled the regions dominated by the Coalition States. Ever vigilant, CS forces continued to investigate every rumor or suspicion of shape-changers operating within their domain. That belief was dispelled when a branch of the Chi-Town ISS foiled a hit team sent to kill Emperor Prasek in I 06 P.A. All five conspirators were slain trying to escape, leading to an autopsy. The standard AG Test revealed one of the seemingly human assassins was really an Auto-G. Military code-breakers confirmed the authorities' worst suspicions 36 hours later when they pierced the defense codes on a computer disk found on the body of the Auto-G. The disk contained a comprehensive profile, complete with old and new video footage, on each member of the Prosek family. It also revealed a plan to secretly kill either the Emperor or Joseph II and have the shape changer take his place to undermine the CS from within. It also references \"Team Two.\" So far, Team Two has never manifested or it members may have been scared away or slain by CS security without realizing it. Who may have ordered the \"hit\" is unknown, but the Federation of Magic and Tolkeen are at the top of the list. How many other Auto-Gs may exist in North America is unknown. Most authorities believe there may be as few as 40 or 50, and certainly no more than 200-600 throughout North America.\n\n(see Rifts® World Book 30: D - Bees of North America pg. 27 for more information)`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/race/auto_g.jpg';\n        this.availableOCCs = `    In theory, any, but Auto-Gs tend toward the following: Bounty Hunter (and any type of man-hunter), Master Assassin, Freelance Spy, Super-Spy, Professional Thief, Bandit, Highway Man, Smuggler, Con Artist, Gunfighter, Gunslinger, Sheriff, or Mere Soldier.

Heals three times faster than a human and is resistant to most diseases. When replicating an inhuman race, the character has all the natural abilities of that race, other than spell casting and specific learned skills and memories.\n\nTrue form\nThe Auto-G can only assume one of two forms, the current person or race he is copying and the creature's (supposedly) natural human form. The human form is usually quite attractive, with a P.B. of 12 or higher. Most Auto-Gs have a healthy, youthful appearance and those between 90-110 look to be in their forties or early fifties. \nAn Auto-G has a definite male or female gender, but they can assume the \"appearance\" of the opposite sex when they transform into a different race. Assuming the opposite sex and acting the part can prove difficult as the shape-changer may be a male in a female body and vice versa, with all his normal male attitudes and instincts. Acting the part of a female (and vice versa) may be harder than one thinks. \nWhen abandoning their false identity, the Auto-G can only revert back to his or her human-looking natural form. To change into another race, he must consume some DNA from that life form.\n\nDNA sample required to change\nTo assume the identity of another race, be it Dog Boy, Psi-Stalker or D-Bee, the Auto-G must have something with that being's genetic signature. This requires the shape shifter to chew and/or swallow something with the subject's DNA; spit, sweat, blood, a piece of skin, nail or hair follicle, and so on. The DNA source material can be as little as a single hair follicle or a tiny drop of blood. One minute (four melee rounds) after consumption, the Auto-G is able to replicate the exact genetic structure of that race and transform itself into a convincing, physical copy down to the genetic level. Note: This only enables the Auto-G to turn into an identical member of that race, not an exact copy of a specific individual. Limitations: An Auto-G can copy any intelligent, humanoid creature pro-vided it is mortal, whether it is an S.D.C. or M.D.C. being, including its size, appearance, additional limbs (tail, wings, extra eyes or limbs, natural body armor, etc.). An Auto-G can NOT replicate a supernatural being, creature of magic, animal or a being who is extremely alien, such as an intelligent blob like the Amorph, and energy being like the Ecto-Man, or D-Bee made of stone or plant matter. In all cases, the Auto-G retains his own memories and skills, but he also has the natural abilities and instincts that come with the body he has assumed.\n\nTo replicate a specific individual, the Auto-G must be able to thoroughly examine the subject (dead or alive) for at least 15 minutes (20-30 is better), consume a large DNA sample (one ounce minimum) and be within 12 feet (3.6 m) of said individual when the change takes place. After the ap-propriate amount of time, concentration and meditation, the Auto-G turns into an identical-looking twin down to the smallest detail and genetic composition. Fingerprints, voice, eye and skin color, hair, and natural moles, as well as scars and blemishes caused by injury or birth defect, are all replicated 99.7 percent. Bionic implants, tattoos and body piercings cannot be replicated and if the Auto-G is to complete the charade, he must be physically altered (i.e., get an identical tattoo, implant, etc.). Strangely, while the Auto-G cannot make a tattoo appear when it changes its form, the tat-too will disappear when he reverts back to his natural, human form. Likewise, any cybernetic implants or bionic limbs will be harmlessly expelled and the Auto-G will regenerate any missing limbs or organs. In fact, if a bionic arm or leg is required for the disguise (typically only necessary when replicating a specific individual), the Auto-G appears without that limb when he transforms into that individual awaiting the bionic supplement to be attached to complete the trans-formation. Upon returning to his normal form, all limbs are intact and bionic free. \nWhen assuming the exact identity of a specific individual, it is not necessity to kill the genuine article. Auto-Gs who respect life or are engaged in a plot to frame an individual, usually work to get the subject sent off on a wild goose chase, or capture and imprison the person until there is no need for the charade. On the other hand, evil and ruthless Auto-Gs, many of whom are professional assassins and spies, kill those they impersonate and destroy the body (or at least dispose of it) to prevent accidental escape or discovery.\n\nInstant adaptation to new body\nThe Auto-G is instantly comfortable with his new body and understands how it works on an intuitive level even if it is completely different than a human being; has additional appendages and inhuman powers (psionics, instincts, heightened senses, wings and flight, aquatic capabilities, M.D.C. body, superhuman P.S., special powers, and so forth). For example, if an Auto-G turns into a Simvan, he has the power to control and command animals. If he turns into a Lyn-Srial, the Auto-G has wings and can fly.\n\nUnusually high level of P.P.E.\nAuto-Gs have 2D4x10+P.E. attribute number in P.P.E., roughly 10-30 times more than the average human adult. Yet despite this, Auto-Gs can-not perform magic of any kind nor can their P.P.E. be syphoned away by sorcerers, Psi-Stalkers or other P.P.E. vampires. Additionally, the Auto-G's P.P.E. drops by 70%for 24 hours after a transformation into a nonhuman life form. Presumably, the expenditure of P.P.E. at the moment of transformation is necessary for the Auto-G to change his genetic structure and appearance.

They lack any sort of natural \"powers.\" They have no inherent mystical or psychic ability, no Mega-Damage skin nor Supernatural Strength. They are not predisposed to any skilled profession or area of study. Even their appearance is decidedly average, mirroring that of the native humans with the exception of their ashen gray skin and small, lidless, all-black eyes. Thus, Dram ins blend in seamlessly to the backdrop of the world. \n    In cultural and societal aspects, however, they are extremely alien. Try to imagine that you are the only being that really, truly exists in the whole world. Everything you see and touch -the rocks, the plants, the air, the animals, and the people - are all complex illusions. The world and the entire Megaverse are massive constructs built around you. Everything exists as some sort of game, trial, or test for you to complete as best you can. \n    As bizarre as it sounds, this is the way that virtually every individual Dramin views the world and his place in it. It is a deeply-ingrained perspective encoded into their being to which 99% of the race prescribes. It isn't an organized faith or social order, but each individual Dramin takes it upon him or herself to find the best path on the way to the end goal, whatever that may be. To outsiders, this seems terribly complicated and illogical, but to a Dramin it's simple. Each person takes his own view of things, but the choices to be made are the same: What am I meant to do? What is my ultimate purpose? How do I best achieve it? \n    Many choose to view the world from a spiritual perspective and believe that everything was created by an all-powerful being. These Dramins believe that they are being observed to see whether or not they are worthy for the real world, another stage of existence, or even for the afterlife. For most of these Dramins, their god is a nameless being to whom they alone answer, but some find the truths they are seeking in one established religion or another, usually in a god who promotes good over evil and rewards good works and acts of charity. Most of these individuals strive to help others, fight injustice, or achieve enlightenment through study and prayer. They become healers, teachers, and champions. Many find callings as lawmen, clerics, or modem knights-errant, challenging evil in all of its forms in the hopes of doing good in the eyes of their god. \n    Other Dramins take a scientific view of the situation, and believe that they are little more than the subject of an experiment or an expansive simulation. They may see themselves as rats trying to make it to the reward in the center of a maze, or as students taking the mother of all examinations. Dram ins with this world-view tend to be problem-solvers, tackling challenges to cure a disease or build a better mousetrap. They gravitate toward technical and scientific professions, and are often students for life. Their studies may prompt them to travel across and be-tween worlds to seek knowledge or find the challenge that will define life and get them to the end of their test. \n    Others take a carefree attitude toward life and live \"in the moment.\" They live to eat, drink, and be merry without a second thought for what tomorrow may bring. They relieve themselves of the cares and responsibilities of the world; nothing that they do makes a difference anyway, right? Many of these Dramins become terrible oppressors, despots, power-mongers or party animals who seek to satisfy their own whims and desires with-out regard for others. They are the typically careless, rude, and vile segment of the Dram in population and are often hedonists in the extreme, satisfying their baser urges above all else.

The non-combat use is a sort of shared communication. Everybody entranced can share in the psionic experiences of the group leader, the character who is using the Group Trance power. First, the entire group of willing participants enters into a trance state. While entranced, the group is subtly linked to the character using the power. That psychic can then perform one or two other psychic communication abilities per melee round. These abilities are limited to a few forms of psionic communication (not Healing, Physical or Super-Psionic powers), including Clairvoyance, Empathy, Telepathy, Object Read, Presence Sense, Commune with Spirits, Remote Viewing, and Sixth Sense. The thoughts/visions/images, communications received by the lead psychic are simultaneously transmitted via the trance-link to all participants. They see,, know or feel everything he does. \n    The other use of this ability is to willingly pool the I.S.P. of the trance gr up to make it available to the lead psychic (the one who is using the Group Trance ability). Once every melee round, the psychic to whom they are linked can draw upon three I.S.P. points from each psychic in the trance group. I.S.P. cannot be drawn from characters who don't have any. These I.S.P. can be used by the lead psychic any way he desires. The others linked to him see, feel and experience whatever he does, including his rationale, motives and emotions. \n    In both instances, only the psychic group leader has any melee actions, and 'he is limited to two psionic actions/attacks while entranced. All those in the group are simply passive observers and secondary participants. P,.ll participants react calmly toward the events, emotions, and visions they experience while entranced. The moment the trance ends, they are back to normal and can respond as is appropriate. Only the lead psychic or the genuine fear of death can break the trance.

This means the person takes the time to carefully aim and squeeze off one, well placed shot. Each individual shot takes one full attack. Thus, if a character has four attacks per melee they can shoot FOUR aimed shots. This applies to all weapons. Roll to strike for each strike.\n\nShort Burst: +1 to strike. A burst is the shooting of several rounds, immediately one after another. Aim is more hasty and the recoil moves the weapon with each shot, reducing the accuracy. Semiautomatic/automatic weapons, machineguns, and sub-machineguns, are designed for burst firing. The concept if that, while accuracy is reduced, the odds of hitting one's target with multiple rounds is increased because more shots are fired. Roll to strike once to see if the entire burst hits. Do not roll for individual bullets. If the burst misses its target, then all rounds in the burst miss. Short bursts fire 20% of the entire magazine (i.e. 30 round magazine uses 6 rounds in a short burst). Roll normal damage for one round, then double. Uses one attack/action. Can be fired at one target only.\n\nLong Burst: +1 to strike. This burst fires 50% of the entire magazine (i.e. 30 round magazine uses 15 rounds in a long burst). Roll normal damage for one round then multiply by 3. Uses one attack/action. Can be fired at one target only.\n\nEntire Magazine Burst: Shooting off the entire magazine/clip within a melee round is possible. 100% of the rounds are fired. Roll normal damage for one round then multiply by 7. Uses up two attacks/actions that melee. Can be fired at only one target; machineguns (W.P. Heavy) are the only exception to this.\n\nWild/Spray: No bonus or penalty. Shooting a spray at several targets at once is possible, but is the same as shooting wild. You must fire a long burst or an entire magazine burst in order to spray. Shooting wild occurs when a trained character shoots without taking time to aim. This usuaully applies when the person is blinded, angry, running, rolling, leaping, shooting from a moving vehicle, etc. With the correct W.P.this mode of fire gains no bonus or penalty. Without the correct W.P. this mode of firing strikes at -6 penalty. Counts as two attacks/actions. Can be fired at one target or as a spray:-\nOne Target: roll normal damage for one round then double it. When using this mode of fire there is a 20% chance that an innocent bystander is possibly hit. Damage is for one round only (a wild shot).\nSpray (to hit several targets simultaneously): roll once to determine if the target area is hit: 1D20; 5 or higher strikes as usual. Roll 1D4 to determine number of individual targets struck within that target area. However, each target gets a dodge to avoid getting shot. Damage is normal damage from one round. when using this mode of fire there is a 50% chance of hitting innocent bystanders doing one round damage (a wild shot).`;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = WPEnergyPistol;","const Spell = require('../Spell');\n\nclass CloseRift extends Spell {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.name = 'Close Rift';\n        this.group = 'Invocation';\n        this.level = 'Fourteen';\n        this.range = `100 feet (30.5 m).`;\n        this.duration = `Instant results.`;\n        this.cost = `200 P.P.E. plus 2 P.P.E. from the character's permanent P.P.E. base!`;\n        this.savingThrow = `Standard.`;\n        this.description = `    The master of magic can close a Rift by sheer force of will.

The weapon can strike up to three targets with a single attack/melee action. It can strike the initial target twice, but only if it ricochets off something (or someone) else as its second strike. The spell caster rolls to strike as normal, and if the weapon hits, it inflicts damage, then skips off the initial target and streaks towards the next. The same strike roll is used, and if it hits again, it does damage and goes to the third target.

Rope`;\n        this.group = `Weapon Proficiencies Ancient`;\n        this.isSecondary = true;\n        this.description = `This is trained use of a lariat or lasso for combat as well as using the lasso to snare and hook onto a sturdy object or limb for climbing, scaling walls, boarding vessels, and swinging across openings. As a weapons, the rope and lasso is used to encircle the shoulders,arms, waist or feet to snare, trip and otherwise pin and incapacitate an opponent. The lasso can also ensnare the neck and strangle opponents.\n\nTrip Attacks: A successful roll to strike knocks the victim to the ground and they lose initiative and one melee attack/action. If the attacker is on horseback, in a vehicle, or super strong, they may pull or drag the victim.\n\nEntangle Attacks: A successful roll to strike ensnares the desired area of the body, typically the arm, upper torso, waist, leg, or foot. A subsequent successful roll to disarm or entangle may be then made.\n\nDisarm Attacks: After a successful Entangle Attack, a further successful roll to strike means the lasso is jerked in such a way that it slips off the victim's arm, but it takes whatever they were holding in that hand with it. 60% chance of knocking it to the ground, 61-100% chance the item is lassoed and can be pulled into the attacker's hand in two melee actions (four total attacks are used up: one to entangle the arm, one to disarm the arm, and two to pull the item).\n\nIncapacitate Attacks: After a successful Entangle Attack, a further successful roll to strike means the attacker can incapacitate that limb/part of the body (usually by pulling the rope and the lassoed limb taut), making it impossible for the victim to use it. If an arm or hand, the victim must use their other arm and hand (at half their usual bonuses and -1 melee attack unless they are ambidextrous).\n\nIf it is the foot or leg that is lassoed and incapacitated (pulled tight), the victim runs or hops at half speed, can not get away unless they can cut the rope, is -4 to dodge and roll with impact, and -1 to parry, disarm, or pull punch. Using s a second melee attack to jerk the lasso will knock the victim off their feet (losing initiative and one melee attack)and he can then be pulled/dragged by hand, horse, or vehicle, or hog-tied (costs the attacker two additional melee attacks/actions unless the victim can roll a 17 or higher to dodge the attacker succeeds without further incident. A roll of 17or higher enables the victim to squirm and move in such a way as to prevent being tied up and they can then engage the attacker in hand to hand combat).\n\nIf it is the upper body that is lassoed, it pins one arm to their body rendering it useless. The victim must use their other hand (at half their usual bonuses and -1 melee attack unless they are ambidextrous). A second lasso around the upper body (counts as another melee attack) pins both arms, leaving the victim unable to use their arms or hands. Trying to run while the arms are pinned is awkward and difficult, reduce the victim's speed by 20%, they are -2 to dodge and can not parry. No damage is inflicted, but the victim is physically incapacitated. Moreover, the lassoed individual can be pulled off their feet and knocked down (losing initiative and one melee attack/action) and can be quickly hog-tied by the attacker (counts as four melee attacks) or be dragged. Only one victim can be toped and pinned or hog-tied at a time.\n\nMultiple lassos can also be used to snare each limb and 'spread-eagle' the victim. The victim is physically helpless in this position. Only spell magic or psionics or other special attacks can be used when spread-eagled, arms pinned or completely hog-tied.\n\nStrangle Attack: Roping the neck can be sued to prevent the victim from speaking and makes them barely able to breathe (-1 attack per melee). Tightening the rope (counts as one melee attack) cuts the air supply off completely and strangles the victim unless they can cut themselves free or the attacker releases the victim by loosening and/or removing the lasso from around the neck. Depending on how long the victim can go without air, the victim may die. For most characters, dizziness occurs within 2 minutes (victim is -2 attacks per melee and -3 on all combat bonuses). Within 4 minutes the victim is rendered unconscious, unless they can hold their breath for an extraordinarily long time. If still on their feet, reduce their attacks and combat bonuses by half again. Within 2 or 3 minutes the victim will lapse into a coma and die within another 1D4 minutes. Note: A slow hanging kills the victim in half the time. A good character would never use a strangling attack to kill or hang, or stops short of causing coma and death. The strangling attack does NOT work on characters clad in power armour or full conversion cyborgs, or robots. Against a supernatural being or creature of magic, the attacker must have greater Supernatural Strength then the victim.\n\nEscaping a Lasso: Escape is possible if the victim is able to cut themselves free (provided they have a blade weapon or claws), shoot themselves free with a gun (first shooting the tow-line and then pulling the lasso from around their neck, counts as two melee attacks/actions), or pull themselves free if their P.S. is six points greater than their attacker.\n\nIt takes 1D4 melee actions to cut through an S.D.C. lasso with a S.D.C. knife, one action if an M.D. blade is used or the character has a Robotic or Supernatural P.S.. It is impossible, however, to draw a weapon and cut oneself loose if both arms are pinned or while being dragged. Of course, psionic or magical telekinesis or ectoplasm may be used to wield the blade, or some other extraordinary measure may be applicable (eye beam, bionic finger blaster, etc.).\n\nW.P.

The character can make an object hop, fall, roll, rise into the air, suspend it there (hover) or make it fly across the room. \n    In order to move an object by Telekinesis, the item must be clearly visible, within the psychic's range (60 feet/18.3 m) and the point of focus. As usual, the psychic must concentrate on what he is doing; thus, each telekinetic feat counts as one of the character's physical attacks. The total number of telekinetic attacks is equal to the character's number of physical attacks per melee; usually 4 or 5. One can attack with Telekinesis by hurling an object as if thrown or causing it to buzz about a room, swinging and hitting like a club controlled by an invisible hand. Several objects can be telekinetically thrown around within the same melee round, but not simultaneously. The psychic can only concentrate on one item at a time. For example: A physical psychic with four, normal, hand to hand attacks per melee can perform four attacks with Telekinesis. First. he makes a flower vase fly from the table, aiming it at his opponent's head. Second, he makes the lamp hurl at the guard at the door. Third, the table is suddenly flipped up on end and, fourth. the doorknob is turned and the door flung open. Four attacks or actions using Telekinesis. \n    As we can sec in the example, Telekinesis can be used to do more than making objects fly around. The Telekinetic power can be used to open doors. flick switches, press buttons, turn knobs and dials, open windows. make a rocking chair rock and so on. The range of possibilities is extensive when you stop and think about it. Remember, each action counts as one of the character's physical actions/attacks per me lee. \n    It is easiest to move or hurl small objects weighing two pounds (0.9 kg or less) Maximum height or distance is 60 feet (18.3 m). Medium-sized objects weighing 3 to 20 pounds (1.35 to 9 kg) are more difficult to manipulate. Maximum height or distance is reduced by half; 30 feet (91 m) Large or heavy objects weighing over 20 lbs (9 kg) are the most difficult lo maneuver. reducing maximum height and distance to 15 feet (46 m) IS.P. cost for large. heavy objects is 8 I.S.P. for the first 20 lbs (9 kg) plus one I.S.P. for each additional 10 lbs (4.5 kg) of weight. This means it would cost 19 I.S.P. to move a 125 lb. (56.2 kg) weight (8 ISP. for the first 20 lbs (9 kg) +11 I.S.P. for the remaining 105 lbs). Remember. the height and distance of effect is limited to 15 feet (4 6 m) for such a heavy object. \n\nTelekinesis Combat Bonuses:\n• + 3 to strike with Telekinesis; physical/skill bonuses to strike do not apply when Telekinesis is used. \n• +4 to parry with Telekinesis by using a controlled object to parry or sheer telekinetic force to block an attack. Counts as a medium heavy object; costs 8 J.S.P. Note: Only these two bonuses apply to TK combat. \n• S.D.C Damage from Hurled Objects: \n    Very Small: 6 ounces to 1 pound (0.23 to 0.45 kg): 1D4. \n    Small: 1.5 to 2 lbs (0.6 to 0.9 kg): 1D6. \n    Medium Small: 2-4 lbs (0.9 to 1.8 kg): 2D4. \n    Medium: 5 to 10 lbs (2.25 to 4.5 kg): 3D4. \n    Medium Large: 11 to 25 lbs (4.95 to 11.2 kg) 3D6. \n    Large: 26 to 40 lbs (11.7 to 18 kg): 4D6.

Furthermore, a failed roll to make a telekinetic parry means the psychic did not parry and is struck by his opponent. \n    Telekinesis moves, lifts and throws physical objects with the power of the mind. so it may be used to hurl a victim into something as a slam attack but NOT as a crushing or thrusting attack in and of itself. Objects thrown would be equivalent to objects thrown by a physical hand.

These psychics can create fire out of thin air, cause things to simply burst into flames, and use fire as a weapon. This rather spectacular display of psychic power has made the Burster one of the most feared of all the psychic characters, second only to the Mind Melter. Although other powerful psychics may possess the Super-Psionic power of Pyrokinesis, the abilities of the Burster far outstrip those of the fundamental ability possessed by others In addition to being able to create fire with a thought, the psychic can actually \"burst\" into flame. Flames that provide a warm and protective covering and which give the character a frightening visage and enhanced power.\n    Bursters are extremely passionate about ... well, everything. They feel their emotions and beliefs deeply and are not shy about showing them. The more intense emotions, joy, love, hate and anger, burn the hottest within Bursters and are the most likely to elicit an intense react10n. Few Bursters are wishy-washy about anything. They are steadfast and outspoken in their beliefs and quick to action. While some are quite literally ''hot heads\" with short tempers and explosive anger, most tend to be warm, sincere people who generally exhibit a fair amount of self-control. It's just that they are deeply committed to whatever beliefs, feelings and/or people they care about and are not afraid to take a stand or fight those who threaten them or their loved ones. \n    Many observers have noted that Bursters are a study of duality d extremes. Most Bursters are either Principled and Scrupulous or Miscreant and Diabolic - extreme good or extreme evil - rarely anything in between. They are notorious for their hot emotions, terrible anger and powers of destruction, yet they are just as likely to be generous and kind to strangers in need, and amazingly loyal to friends and loved ones. A symbol of destruction and fiery violence, the Burster often seeks peace and order, and looks to build and nurture (a belief, place, people, ideal, etc.) rather than destroy Good or evil, idealistic or sardonic, the Burster will be passionate about his position, purpose and goals, and enjoys what he does.\n    Part of this comes from the very nature of fire, one of the four ancient, mystical elements. Fire itself plays important dual roles in human life. It can be used to provide light, warmth, protection from animals, the power (through heat and chemical reaction) to change and shape other elements (rock, metal, water) into useful building materials, or serve as a source of energy. In this capacity, fire nurtures, protects, helps and builds, but then there is the other side of fire, the destroyer. Fire can rage uncontrolled and destroy everything it touches In this capacity, it becomes a wild thing that leaps from place to place and down that which it helped to build. It kills without mercy and without conscience. It is a destructive force to be feared. Paradoxically, the Burster tends to be the living embodiment of fire - a builder and destroyer, a warm and noble spirit who, i f hurt or provoked, can transform into a cold-hearted destroyer with a fiery wrath.\n    As hot and extreme personalities, Bursters who choose an evil course are wicked in the extreme (Miscreant or Diabolic) and relish causing pain and suffering. They destroy that which offends or annoys them and, often, that which they cannot understand. On the other hand, a good Burster can be astonishingly virtuous and compassionate. They fight for those who cannot do so for themselves and take up worthy causes. They fight with passion and conviction that is hard to find, and can be as honorable and heroic as the best Cyber-Knight. Of course, there are those who don't quite fit either mold. An Aberrant aligned Burster, for example, will never waver from his (twisted) code of ethics. Anarchist individuals are likely to be selfish in the extreme or uncharacteristic in their lack of conviction or purpose. An Unprincipled Burster will be all too aware of his dual nature and constantly at odds with himself, always struggling to do the right thing despite emotions to the contrary. \n           \n(seeRifts® Ultimate Edition pg. 139 for more information)\n\nPlayer Note\nLike most Master Psychics, the Burster has minimal education, having spent much of the time learning and mastering his or her pyrokinetic powers. The individual has come to rely on those powers, wits, and experience. The typical Burster is a cocky, self-confident adventurer who prefers to use his or her powers and courage rather than skills or machines.`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/occ/Burster.jpg';\n        this.raceDesc = `Most common among humans (87%), Elves (5%), Ogres (5%) and 3% others, typically human-like races.`;\n        this.recommendedAttributes = `None.

The duration, range, and damage of his powers are doubled when at or near (one mile/1.6 km) a ley line nexus point!\n\nImpervious to Fire and Heat\nA psionic aura radiates around the Burster, making him and what he is wearing, completely impervious to fire and heat. Even Mega-Damage plasma, napalm, a dragon's fire breath, and magic fires do nothing but minor cosmetic damage (singe clothing or armor, damage a delicate item, etc.). Even the most intense Mega-Damage blaze does no damage whatsoever. This also means the character can pick up and hold hot coals, burning timbers, eat fire (for show, not nourishment), and walk or stand in fire without discomfort or catching on fire; it feels natural and invigorating. This natural ability also means the Burster is unaffected by smoke. He can breathe unimpaired in the thickest billowing clouds of smoke. Vision is only slightly obscured, roughly half the usual distance and clarity of sight, speed is reduced by a meager 10%, and combat penalties are only -1 to strike, parry, and dodge; most humans and D-Bees are blinded by smoke (-10 on all combat rolls, -25% on skills and -50% on Spd) and choke on the noxious fumes (roughly the same as tear gas) and a normal person will choke to death from smoke inhalation in a matter of 1D6+4 minutes.\nThis protective aura even helps protect against electricity (M.D. attacks inflict half damage, S.D.C. attacks just tingle), and this character never sweats.\n\nExtinguish Fires\nThe Burster can instantly put out flames without need of chemicals or water. The fire just disappears because the character can psionically channel and control the energy to make it stop spreading and quickly go out.\nRange: 100 feet (30.5 m) + 10 feet (3 m) per level of experience.\nRadius of Effect: The psychic can extinguish a 200 foot (61 m) radius per level of experience. His/her level of control is such that the Burster can either go for the maximum (usually in an effort to save lives and/or property) or narrowly focus it to affect a comparatively small area. Duration: Permanent; until the fire is reignited.\nI.S.P. Cost: 4.\n\nFlame Burst (Self)\nThe psychic can seemingly cause himself to burst into flames and become completely engulfed in fire. In reality, this is a fiery aura around him. Nothing on the Burster's person is actually on fire, so nothing is damaged. Furthermore, the character can move around without difficulty. However, the fire will ignite anything he touches, such as carpeting, drapes, furniture, paper, wood, etc.\nRange: Self.\nDuration: Two minutes per level of experience. S.D.C.\nDamage: 6D6 S.D.C. damage per strike to anyone or thing that he touches. Damage is accumulative. Plus, all combustible articles such as clothing will catch on fire, doing an additional 6D6 S.D.C. damage per melee round until extinguished. The flames are not powerful enough to damage M.D.C. items/armor unless within a mile (1.6 km) of a ley line nexus point, then the damage can be increased to 1D4 MD. (and 2D4 directly at a nexus), but costs two extra Inner Strength Points.\nMega-Damage: 1D6 M.D. (or 1D6xl00 S.D C.) can be inflicted (2D6 M.D. at ley lines and 3D6 M.D. at a nexus) if the Burster concentrates intensely to inflict maximum damage. This 1D6 M.D. can be added to damage from the Burster's punches, kicks, or simply by being touched!\nNote: Additional cost of 8 I.S.P. for the M.D. attacks, lasts only one melee round per level of experience and each M.D. fire attack (punch, kick, head butt, grapple, etc.) counts as two melee actions/attacks.\nI.S.P. Cost: 4.\n\nFlame Burst Body Protection (Special)\nThe aura of fire from the Flame Burst also prov1Des a limited M.D.C. field of protection equal to 30 M.D.C. +6 per level of experience, and which renews itself at a rate of 3D6 M.D.C. per melee round (never more than the normal maximum).\nNote: There is no extra I.S.P. cost for this aura of protection; it comes with the Flame Burst.\n\nFire Bolt\nA fiery energy bolt can be hurled or fired from the forehead or hands ( even if the latter is an artificial appendage).\nRange: 200 feet (61 m) +20 feet (6 m) per level of experience.\nDuration: Instant; counts as one melee action/attack.\nBonus to Strike: +4; line of sight.\nDamage: Mini-bolt 2D6 S.D.C./Hit Points, medium bolt 4D6 S.D.C., heavy bolt 6D6 S.D.C., or Mega-Damage plasma bolt: 2D6 M.D.\nI.S.P. Cost: Two, regardless of the size and damage for an S.D.C. blast, and four points to create an M.D. blast.\n\nFire Eruption\nThe pyrokinetic can cause a fire to erupt in front of somebody or an area (never directly on a living creature) instantly and without the need of combustible material. The size of the flame can be controlled to be only a few inches tall and cover only an inch or two area, or several yards/meters tall and across. The flame will burn as long as its creator wills it to (costs one additional I.S.P. per 10 minutes) and cannot be extinguished by normal means because it is fueled by psychic energy. If the Burster is rendered unconscious, blinded or distracted, the flame disappears. If the Fire Eruption is created in an area where other combustible items are located ( carpet, wood, flooring, walls, ceiling, paper, fuel depot, etc.), they will catch fire within 1D4 melee rounds (i.e. one minute or less). The burning of these materials is a separate, regular fire that can be extinguished normally, but will spread and may cause immense damage just as any fire would.\nRange: 100 feet (30 m) +20 feet (6 m) per level of experience. A specific target must be visible, while a target area does not have to be visible, but its precise location must be known to the Burster, i.e. causing a fire to erupt in the adjoining room or the room directly above him, etc.\nNote: -25% to accurately hit a target he cannot see if it is smaller than 20 feet ( 6 m) in diameter.\nDuration: The flame eruption will stay ignited for 10 minutes or until the Burster cancels the effect, which can be done at will. The psychic can keep the fire burning y expending an additional one I.S.P. every 10 minutes, but must stay within range and concentrate on maintaining the fire.\nPenalties: Melee actions are reduced by half and fighting is impossible unless the Burster breaks his concentration, causing the fire to disappear. However, any combustible items set ablaze by it will continue to burn and the fire spreads until extinguished, even after the psionic fire is gone.\nBonus to Strike: This is a little different than the usual strike attack. The Burster must learn to judge distances and focus his thoughts in order to create the eruption exactly where he wants it. So instead of an attack bonus, there is a\nBase Skill: 48% +4% per additional level of experience (roll percentile dice). A failed roll means the eruption happens 2D6 yards/meters off target. The Bursters -25% to accurately hit a target he cannot see if it is smaller than 20 feet (6.1 m) in diameter. Huge targets are easier to hit, but even then the blinded Burster is -5% to strike.\nS.D.C. Damage: Tiny flame 1D4 S.D.C., 1-2 yards/meters fire 4D6 S.D.C., a towering pillar or wall (6 feet/1.8 m tall or bigger) 1D4x10 S.D.C., filling a room or 20 square foot (6 m) area or larger causes 2D4x10 S.D.C. damage ( or one M.D. point) per melee round or whenever somebody attempts to run through it.\nMega-Damage: The fire can be increased to Mega-Damage destruction by expending twice as many,l.S.P.; applicable only to the larger fires, walls, pillars, and areas. An M.D. fire wall or pillar inflicts 2D6 M.D., 20 foot (6 m) area does 4D6 M.D. and 40 feet (12.2 m) or bigger does 6D6 M.D. per melee round or whenever somebody tries to run through it. Combustible items burn hotter and the fire spreads four times faster than a normal S.D.C. fire.\nI.S.P. Cost: 10 for S.D.C. fires regardless of size. 20 I.S.P. to create a Mega-Damage fire. Maximum Size Limitations: 20 foot area (6.1 m) +5 feet (1.5 m) per level of experience.\n\nSense Fire\nThis psionic ability enables the character to sense if there is a fire as small as a burning candle nearby. To sense the fire, the Burster must stop and concentrate for a moment (15 seconds/one melee round). A moment later, he receives psychic impressions that indicate the approximate size (big, medium,\nsmall, tiny) and the approximate distance (near or far), the general direction (north, south, east, west, and, if in a building, up or down). He can also tell whether it is contained, spreading slowly, or raging out of control, as well as whether it is a natural/acc1Dental fire or an intentional/man-made or magical fire (arson), and how long it has been burning (minutes, hours, days). The psychic can also examine burnt objects or ashes and effectively \"object read\" them to get an impression of how long ago the fire last burned and whether it was natural or man-made. This affinity with fire also enables the Burster to recognize Fire Elementals and sense the presence of supernatural creatures of fire, including Fire Elementals of all kinds, fire-based demons, Fire Demon Automatons (see Rifts® Federation of Magic'™) and Fire/Water Elemental Fusionists, but not Fire Dragons or other Bursters, unless the latter has burst into flames or is controlling a psionic induced Fire Eruption.\nNote: This psychic power does not disclose who made the fire, nor how many people may have been involved, nor are exact locations revealed, although it can be used to track down a fire in a search. Also note that the Sense Fire ability applies to fires, not machines or engines that radiate heat.\nRange: Sensing for a burning fire will cover an 800 foot (244 m) radius + 100 feet (30.5 m) per level of experience. Examining ashes or burnt debris requires touching it.\nDuration: Requires 15 seconds of preparatory concentration, but the psychic impressions and being in tune to the fire(s) lasts for four minutes, thus the character can use this ability to track down fires, i.e. \"we're getting close\" ... \"oh no, it's spreading\" ... \"it's behind that door,\" and so on.\nDamage: None.\nI.S.P. Cost: Two.\nNote: If a Burster uses the power of Telepathy, Empathy or See Aura, he can also sense if the target of his psychic probe is a fire bug/arsonist.\n\nSuper Fuel Flame\nThe character can feed a fire with psychic energy, increasing its size by as little as twofold or as much as 10 times.\nRange: 100 feet (30.5 m) per level of experience.\nArea of Effect: 20 foot (6 m) area per level of experience.\nDamage: Increased proportional to the size of the fire; G.M. discretion.\nI.S.P. Cost: 8.`;\n        this.alignment = `Any, but tends to lean toward strong good (Principled and Scrupulous) or very evil (Miscreant or Diabolic).`;\n        this.startingHandToHand =

A pair of small horns crown the top of their head, with two smaller ones off to the back and side above where one might expect to see their ears. Like a lizard, they have holes in the sides of the head for ears, small eyes and nose, long muzzle and a large mouth filled with jagged, un-even teeth. Despite these reptilian features, the hulking D-Bee is a bipedal mammal. Males have hair on their chin, chest, arms and legs, while females have a more slender build, smaller muzzle, smaller horns and two pairs of small breasts. \n    Larmac are a study in contrast. Reasonably intelligent, large and physically powerful, they can make formidable combatants and warriors to be feared. In fact, most survive as tough scavengers, rough and tumble bandits, and brazen warriors using strong-arm techniques, intimidation and brute force to get by. But that's just it, most Larmac are underachievers who only do enough work to get by and make do on very little. They dream of making it big, but they are low key, easygoing, unmotivated, complacent and downright lazy. The typical Larmac doesn't mind sleeping in the gutter, rummaging through garbage, pan-handling, stealing, intimidating other people into giving him money or buying him food or drink, or beating and robbing people. Of course, they'd just as happily make money gambling or chatting it up and having people buy them drinks for the privilege of their company, but sometimes you have to grab that fruit pie off the windowsill or coat off the truck. Always looking for \"easy money\" and a \"sweet deal,\" Larmac often associate with criminals, gamblers and lowlifes, and make a living (if you can call it that) as petty crooks, informants, runners, lookouts, bouncers, leg breakers, enforcers, body guards, and strong men. \n    When not \"working,\" Larmac have four favorite hobbies: partying, eating, boozing and sleeping. The big D-Bees have been known to party, or \"hop\" from one to another, for days at a time if they can arrange it. When partied out, they'll sleep or lounge around for just as many days, getting up only to eat, drink and relieve themselves. Natural born freeloaders, they stay with an easy job even if they could get something better doing only slightly more work. Likewise, even highly motivated Larmac adventurers and mercenaries stop to stretch out and relax or eat at every opportunity. And when they stop for a little rest and relaxation, the money and booze flow and they party hard. \n    This laid back and easy going disposition can be a good thing when tempers flare, because a Larmac rarely takes action on either side, although he may weigh in with a bit of verbal support (\"I'm with him, so shut up, I'm trying to get some beauty sleep.\") or stir the pot with a joke (\"What are you getting angry about? You can't help it if you're ugly. You were born that way.\"). Attacking a Larmac with words is pointless as they are difficult to rile, go with the flow and prefer to focus on having fun, eating, drinking or sleeping rather than defending their honor or the honor of their buddies. (\"Yeah, yeah, we're all worthless, lazy pigs. Why isn't anybody dancing?\") One will know when the hulking warrior is angry when he growls something like, \"Don't make me get up.\" And if he does get up, one can expect a serious fight on their hands. Even a Larmac only tolerates so much. \n    Although lazy in the extreme, not all Larmac are shiftless, and even the shiftless ones can be motivated. What motivates a Larmac? Dangling the \"big score\" and/or \"easy street\" at him will do it every time. (\"You can retire if we can pull this job off.\" Or, \"You'll make so much money you'll live like a king.\" Or, \"People will be so grateful, you'll never have to pay for a meal or a drink again.\" And so on.) It's not that Larmac are stupid or gullible, because they aren't, it's that they are always willing to work hard for a few days, even a few weeks, if there is the promise of a big payoff in the end. And if that payoff doesn't materialize? Most shrug it off or insist the person who talked them into this waste of time buys them several drinks and a good meal. That's just the way they are. Make a Larmac clean a latrine or stand guard duty and one can expect a lousy job and a sleeping guard. Promise the big lug a week - or better yet, a month - off or easy duty, and one can expect to see a latrine so clean it sparkles. Likewise, if the Larmac is guarding the loot, person or place that leads to \"easy street\" he'll watch it like a hawk and stay awake and alert for 72 hours at a stretch, and fight to the death to protect it! Consequently, if the job doesn't take too long, and his employer knows how to motivate him, a Larmac can be convinced to do almost anything. It's simply a matter of appealing to their nature. Despite the sloth and devil-may-care attitudes of most Larmac, when one of them comes to consider somebody his friend, the hulking D-Bee is loyal and trustworthy to a fault, especially if he is of an Unprincipled or good alignment. On the other hand, Anarchist and evil Larmac are typically cheating, self-serving, backstabbing scum who will betray their own mother if it means a big score or saving their own hide. \n    Ironically, most Larmac are gamblers willing to take high risks and outrageous chances to get what they want. And that re-ward doesn't always have to be money or an easy time. It can be having the joy of showing someone up, saying \"I told ya so,\" helping a friend or extracting revenge. It is difficult sometimes to identify everything that motivates a Larmac, especially those of good alignment or leaning that way. Cruel jokes leveled at him bounce off like rain drops, but teasing a child till he cries, threatening the kindly barmaid and other acts of cruelty leveled at others often get a good Larmac to stir from his rest, dining or revelry long enough to a stop to it. \n\n(see Rifts® World Book 30: D - Bees of North America pg. 118 for more information)`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/race/larmac.jpg';\n        this.alias = `\"Lard Butts,\" \"Lazy Lards\" and \"Lazy Lizards\" by the Coalition and others who find them to be worthless, obese miscreants.`;\n        this.alignment = 'Any, but the majority are Unprincipled (30%), Anarchist (30%), Aberrant ( I 0%) or Miscreant (20%).';\n        this.availableOCCs = `  These underachievers are typically one of the following Adventurer or Men at Arms O.C.C.s (pick one): Bandit, Thief Gambler, Highway Man, Sailor, Pirate, Grunt (or thug/musclemen), Saloon Bum, Barmaid (if female), Saddle Tramp, Stoolie or Vagabond.

The backs of their heads are rather gourd shaped, not unlike a squash or pumpkin, and dotted with tiny red spines. In addition to the color of their skin, the D'norr's devilish appearance comes from their red complexion accented by dark blue eyes, gnarled, pointed ears, and a pair of horns that protrude from the forehead. Four small spines run along the top of each eyebrow and males have 4-6 protruding from their chins. Female D'norr have breasts (they are mammals), a smaller frame and feminine shape.\n    Despite their name and demonic appearance, Devilmen are actually highly intelligent, thoughtful, and compassionate. Most study social behavior, philosophy, the arts, and scholastic pursuits. As a result, many find the sciences and the pursuit of magic to their liking. Moreover, they are much less aggressive than humans and prefer to find a peaceful resolution to problems. This makes these peace-loving D-Bees natural team players and trustworthy teachers, negotiators and diplomats. \n    The Devilmen thrive on social interaction, and accept most intelligent beings until they are proven unworthy of their trust. Rifts Earth is a social and cultural paradise for the D'norr, filled with scores of alien beings with whom they can share their knowledge, philosophies and ideas, as well as learn many new things themselves. They welcome new people and new ideas like hungry children seeking to satisfy a hunger they can never quite quell. Devilmen are especially aware and respectful of the customs and beliefs of other people, which has made them welcomed among Native Americans, Fennodi, Lyn-Srial, Psi-Stalkers, and even Simvan. Most D'norr detest violence and a third are devout pacifists who fight only to defend themselves or to protect the innocent, and even then only long enough to es-cape. This admirable sentiment and lifestyle has made the Devilmen known and respected by Cyber-Knights, the Justice Rangers, Tundra Rangers, and lawmen throughout the New West, as well as at Lazio and New Lazio.

Although they focus on learning a range of spells, they are the undisputed masters of Rift and Ley Line Magic.\n    \nNote:\nThe focus on the dimensional aspect of ley lines gives the Ley Line Rifter the insight to realize that the magic knowledge that comes with communing with a ley line at a new mystic plateau comes from beyond the Rift. That they are tapping into the mind or memory of some long-deceased mage, creature of magic, Demon Lord, Dark God or Alien Intelligence whose memories have been psychically imprinted onto the ley line just as their own memories and anyone who taps the ley lines are) - or - who is linked to the trans-dimensional energy of the nexus point and reaching out to them. This makes Rifters worry that some powerful creature may have access to their minds while entranced. Indeed, there are numerous reports, especially among Rifters, of incidents in which a dark being or Alien Intelligence is able to reach out and communicate with them while they are entranced. As a rule, the conversation is brief and, oddly enough, philosophical. Depending on how the discussion turns, however, it can lead to proposals or suggestions for quests (usually to acquire magic or a magic item that will allegedly give the mage great power, no strings attached - right). Furthermore, Ley Line Rifters and Ley Line Walkers both report having odd dreams, nightmares and, occasionally, visions of an omen or a possible future while entranced. Could these occurrences also be the handiwork of some unseen force connected to the ley line from beyond the grave or beyond our dimension? Insanity for Rifters.

That reduced P.P.E. is listed in parentheses for both lists A and B. Additional spells not on the lists cost their usual P.P.E. amount. \n\nList A: Rift & Ley Line Magic: Dimensional Portal (1000), Ley Line Fade (10), Ley Line Ghost (40 or 120), Ley Line Phantom (20), Ley Line Restoration (400+), Ley Line Resurrection (1000+), Ley Line Shutdown ( 1500), Ley Line Storm Defense (90), Ley Line Tendril Bolts (13), Ley Line Time Capsule (8), Ley Line Time Flux (40), Ley Line Transmission (15), Rift to Limbo (80), Rift Teleportation (100), Rift Triangular Defense System ( 420), Summon Ley Line Storm (250), Swallowing Rift (150). \n\nList B: Astral Projection (5), Calling (4), Call Lightning (5), Chameleon (3), Close Rift (100+), Concealment (3), Detect Concealment (3), Dispel Magic Barriers (8), Energy Disruption (6), Escape (4), Locate (10), Mystic Portal (20), Negate Magic (10), Plane Skip (33), Reality Flux (38), Second Sight (10), Shadow Meld (5), Teleport: Lesser (5), Teleport: Superior (150), Time Hole (105) and Time Slip (10). \n\nLearning New Spells\nA new spell from List A and B can be learned by communing with the ley line. This can occur upon reaching a new mystic plateau (new level of experience), in which the character goes off onto a ley line and goes into a meditative trance that lasts 48 hours. At the end of the trance he knows one spell (pick one) from each list. \nAdditional spells and rituals of any magic level can be learned and or purchased at any time regardless of the character's experience level. See the Pursuit of Magic prior to the Spell Descriptions at the end of this Magic O.C.C. section.\n\nP.P.E.\nLike all practitioners of magic, the Ley Line Rifter is a living battery of mystic energy. He draws upon that energy reserve to cast his spells and use magic. The Line Walker/Rifter has the greatest amount of permanent P.P.E. of all mortal practitioners of magic. Permanent Base P.P.E.: 3D6x10+20 added to the character's P.E. attribute number to start. Plus an additional 3D6 P.P.E. per each additional level of experience starting at level two.\n\nSupplemental P.P.E.\nThe Ley Line Walker can also draw an extra 20 P.P.E. per melee round when on a ley line and 40 when at a ley lines nexus point! P.P.E. can also be stolen from living creatures and people by killing them (hence rituals involving human sacrifices) because their P.P.E. is doubled at the moment of death! However, a character of good or Unprincipled alignment would never do such a thing (except possibly under the most extreme circumstance). People can also willingly give up a portion of their P.P.E. but that's an unusual situation. It's all explained m the section entitled The Principles of Magic, page 185. \n\nP.P.E. Recovery\nFor the Ley Line Walker, spent P.P.E. recovers at a rate of seven points per hour of sleep or rest. Meditation restores P.P.E. at 15 per hour of meditation and is equal to one hour of sleep for this character when it comes to recovery from fatigue and physical rest.`;\n        this.equipmentDesc = `Robe or cape, set of clothing, set of traveling clothes, light M.D.C. body armor (seldom wear heavy armor, be-cause it reduces their speed and mobility by halt), knapsack, back-pack, ID4 small sacks, one large sack, six wooden stakes and mallet (for vampires and other practical applications), canteen, binoculars, tinted goggles or sunglasses, air filter and gas mask, flashlight, I 00 feet (30.5 m) of lightweight cord and grappling hook, pen or pencils and note or sketch pad. Ley Line Walkers like Techno-Wizard items and can use them well. \nWeapons will include a survival knife, hand axe, automatic pistol or submachine-gun (player's choice), energy pistol or rifle, and several extra clips of ammunition. \nThe vehicle of choice is usually a Techno-Wizardry device or hover vehicle or motorcycle or jet pack. They tend toward inexpensive and easy to replace items (or items they can carry, like a Wing Board), because they often have to leave their vehicle behind when traveling along ley lines (phasing).\n\nLey Line Walker Concealed Body Armor \nAlthough it is not usually visible, light to medium body armor is worn under the robes. The chest, shoulders, thighs and back of the head are always 'protected. M.D.C. plating is often used to cover the arms as vambraces ,and armored gauntlets, and the rest of the legs as well. Again, it is either concealed under the robes or loose, baggy clothing, or so stylish it looks like ornamental arm bracelets or vambraces rather than armor. The armor is often made from natural M.D.C. materials like the plates from a Fury Beetle or hide of a dinosaur, and interlaced with M.D. ceramic plates, padding and miracle fibers. M.D.C. metal alloys may be used but are kept to a minimum (less than 50%) because they interfere with the flow of P.P.E. and interfere with the ability to cast spells. Remember, the mage also has magic spells, such as Armor of Ithan, Impervious to Fire, etc., he can cast to provide additional protection for himself. (See page 188 for more on armor.) \n\nStats for Concealed Ley Line Walker Armor\nLight Armor Protection: 2D6+32 M.D.C. main body. Medium Armor: 3D6+50 M.D.C. main body; arms typically have 11-18 M.D.C., legs have 22-28 M.D.C.; -5% to Prowl, Climb, Swimming and other physical skills. Both are very common. Seldom wears heavy body armor. Heavy and full body armor are available in a variety of styles, but are seldom worn (maybe 10% wear them). For one, it's too bulky and uncomfortable, and for another, it's expensive, and lastly, unless it is made predominantly with 'natural materials, conventional environmental armor pre-vents spell casting. Techno-Wizard armor is one alternative for superior protection as well as a few non-magical alternatives, but Mage Armor always requires special consideration and construction to allow spell casting and the use of special abilities.`;\n        this.abilitiesDesc = `Sense Ley Line and Magic Energy\nThe Ley Line Walker can see and feel the presence of magic, providing all of the following sensing abilities as automatic powers which do not require the expenditure of P.P.E.\n• Sense Ley Line\nThe Ley Line Walker is able to feel whether there is a Iey line within the area of his sensing abilities, 10 miles (16 km) per level of experience. He can tell whether it is near or far and follow the feeling to the location of the Iey line. \nBase Skill: 30% +5% per each additional level of experience.\n• Sense Ley Line Nexus\nOnce the Iey line has been found, the walker can follow the Iey line to as many nexus points as it may have. A nexus point is where two or more ley lines cross/intersect. \nBase Skill: 40% +5% per each additional level of experience.\n• Sense a Rift\nThe mage will automatically feel the sensation of a Rift opening or closing anywhere within 50 miles (80 km) of him. Increase the sensing range 10 miles (16 km) per each additional level of experience starting with level two. Although he cannot tell exactly where this Rift is, the mage knows if it is near or far and whether it is big or small. Note: When actually on a ley line, the Line Walker will know exactly where the Rift is located and he can sense one wherever it is, as long as it is on the ley line or a connecting line. \n• Sense Magic in Use\nThe expenditure of magic in the form of a spell, Rifting, or Techno-Wizardry can be felt, if not seen, up to 100 feet (30.5 m) away per every level of the Line Walker's experience. The Ley Line Walker will not know the location nor be able to trace it, but he will feel its energy and know that magic is being used in the area of his sensing range. Note: This does not include the use of psionic powers. \n• See Magic Energy\nThe mage sees magic energy/P.P.E. radiating from people, creatures, objects, and areas, as a faint aura whenever more than 20 P.P.E. points are present. The sensing ability is so acute that the Ley Line Walker can see things made invisible by magic and invisible things that are magical, including invisible dragons and other creatures of magic. This special sight occurs only when the mage de-sires to use it and focuses on seeing the magically invisible. However, the effort uses up one melee attack/action per round (15 seconds) that this special sight is willed in place. Note: Does not work on the spell, Invisibility Superior. Range: Line of sight, about I 000 feet (305 m). \n\nRead Ley Lines\nThis power instills the mage with instant information about the ley line in a matter of moments. The Ley Line Walker will know the following: What directions the ley line runs (and therefore, his location on it; north, south, east, west, etc.), how long the line runs, whether there are any nexus points and where, and whether there are any Rifts presently open along the line. The character also knows about any major natural disasters currently happening along the line, such as a forest fire, flooding, hurricane, or earthquake. War and magic are not natural disasters. The power is automatic and does not require the expenditure of personal P.P.E. \n\nLey Line Transmission\nA Ley Line Walker can send a verbal and/or visual message directly along a ley line to another person so long as that person is located somewhere on the line. The best messages are brief ones of under a hundred words to avoid overwhelming the recipient. Unfortunately, the message is a one way transmission un-less the other person is also a Line Walker or other mage with the Transmission spell. Range is limited only by the length of the ley line and the people's position on the line. The time lapse between sending and receiving a ley line transmission is only a matter of seconds. The message can be sent to one specific person or several people (one per-son per level of the sender's experience), or several people at different locations on the line.\nThe only danger is that a telepathic individual (psionic or magic) may be able to listen in on the message. There is a 01-20% chance that any psionic or magic character with Telepathy will sense a Ley Line Transmission coming through, and eavesdrop (01-31 % chance that they too can receive the message). There is no way for the sender to know if others have eavesdropped on his message. Nor is there any way to scramble the message. This power is an automatic ability for the Ley Line Walker and does not require the expenditure of personal P.P.E. \n\nLey Line Phasing (teleportation)\nA Ley Line Walker also has the power to instantly teleport from one place to another, FLAWLESSLY anywhere on the same ley line. By the way, that can be any-where in any direction (ley lines can be a quarter/0.4 km to one full mile/1.6 km wide!), including up into the air (ley lines are typically a half mile/0.8 km to two miles/3.2 km tall) and hang there because Line Walkers can walk a ley line, as in walk floating above the ground. If he teleports up into the air he can stay there suspended (+20% to Prowl/ hide, because us ground dwelling humans don't usually look up). To do a Ley Line Teleport the mage must concentrate, opening himself to the ley line energy and focusing all of his thoughts to the task of teleporting to the new location. Engaging in conversation or combat, even self-defense, will break the concentration, forcing the mage to start over. The process requires ID4 melees (15 to 60 seconds) of concentration every time before the teleportation happens, so he can't just pop out in a heartbeat, but it's still very, very handy. The teleport is always on target, because the Ley Line Walker is one with the ley line. Of course, unless he can see his destination, he can't know who or what might also be present in that area and he could appear in the middle of an armed camp (but not inside one of them or a tree, etc., as is the dan-ger with the Teleportation spell). \nNote; Ley Line Phasing is an automatic ability common to all Ley Line Walkers at NO P.P.E. cost, but it does take its toll on the body. The maximum number of phasings/teleports possible is four per hour. The per 24 hour period is 4 +2 per each level of experience (6 at level one, 8 at level two, IO at level three, etc). More than this is just impossible. The only other limitations are: 1) He can only teleport himself and his possessions, nobody else. 2) The location must be along the same ley line as if traveling on a mystic railway. To switch to a different ley line, the character must travel or teleport to the nexus point intersection •where two or more different ley lines cross paths to follow one of the other lines.\n\nLey' Line Walking or Line Drifting\nA Ley Line Walker can open himself to the ley line energies and walk or float through the air along the length of the ley line. The speed factor is a mere Speed of 10, but is relaxing and requires absolutely no exertion or even physical movement1 of the feet or body if drifting afloat. NO P.P.E. is necessary for Ley Line Walker to do this, because he's drawing on the ambient energy of the line and his attunement to ley line energy make him practically a living part of the line itself. Note: He can even meditate while drifting down a ley line. Height is typically 1-5 feet (0.3 to 1.5 m) above the ground, but if he concentrates he can reach a height as great as the line itself. This is dangerous, however, as it leaves him out in the open easy to see from a great distance. Just below or just above treetop level is common among those who like to be high above the ground. \n\nLey Line Rejuvenation\nThe character can absorb ley line energy to double the rate of natural healing. To do this, the mage must concentrate and relax on a ley line, letting the mystic energy fill him and heal him over a period of days. The mage can also perform an instant rejuvenation on a ley line as often as once every 24 hours, in which after about ten minutes of concentration, he is completely rested, alert, and healed of 20 Hit Points and 20 S.D.C. + ID6 additional Hit Points and 2D6 S.D.C. (or 4D6 M.D.C. if a Mega-Damage being) per level of experience! Again at no P.P.E. cost, but only possible on a ley line. Note: No P.P.E. or I.S.P. can be restored this way, only Hit Points and S.D.C.\n\nLey Line Observation Ball\nA globe of light, about the size of a soccer ball, can be conjured out of thin air and linked to the Ley Line Walker like a third eye. The sphere of blue or white light can be directed by its creator to zoom ahead or behind him like a remote control spy device or familiar. Everything that the ball sees and hears is instantly transmitted to its maker. The sphere will remain in existence as long as the Ley Line Walker stays within the ley line, or until he dispels it, or until it is destroyed. \nStats for a typical Observation Ball\nM.D.C.: One point per level of its creator. \nRange: Up to 500 feet (152 m) away from its creator per level of its creator, so a fifth level Ley Line Walker could send his Observation Ball 2500 feet away and a tenth level mage almost one mile (1.6 km). \nSpeed: Up to Spd 44 (30 mph/48 km). \nBonuses: + 3 to dodge. It has no offensive capabilities other than to buzz onlookers and possibly startle them (not likely). Actions of that sort, however, require the Ley Line Walker to have line of sight on the ball for him to direct it men-tally, each attack/action of the ball counting as one of his own melee actions/attacks. \n\nAffinity with Rift & Ley Line Magic\nThe Spell Invocations known as Rift & Ley Line Magic are most commonly known by the Ley Line Walker O.C.C These spells common to the Ley Line Walker and although these spells can be important to the profession, the Ley Line \nWalker does not start with any at level one (unless a Ley Line Rifter O.C.C.). They are usually acquired over time. \nThe Rift & Ley Line Magic spells are: Dimensional Portal (1000), Ley Line Fade (20), Ley Line Ghost (80 or 240), Ley Line Phantom (40), Ley Line Restoration (80o+), Ley Line Resurrection (2000+), Ley Line Shutdown (3000), Ley Line Storm Defense (180), Ley Line Tendril Bolts (26), Ley Line Time Capsule (15), Ley Line Time Flux (80), Ley Line Transmission (30), Rift to Limbo (160), Rift Teleportation (200), Rift Triangular Defense System (840), Summon Ley Line Storm (500), Swallowing Rift (300). \nLearning them\nThese spells can be learned by being taught by an elder mage or by communing with the ley line. This can occur upon reaching a new mystic plateau (new level of experience), in which the character goes off onto a ley line allow and goes into a meditative trance that last 48 hours. At the end of the trance he knows one of these spells (pick one). \nThere are two schools of thoughts about Rift & Ley line Magic. One is the typical Line Walker who feel Ley Line Magic is useful, but no more important or significant than any other spell invocation. And the smaller camp who feel Ley Line Magic is of significant and over-riding value. This second camp tends to be a silent minority, for they consider themselves to be elitists with unique and keen insights and whose focus make them special. These mages are Ley Line Rifters who focus on learning all the spells above and similar energy and dimension types of Invocations (described immediately after the Ley Line Walker O.C.C.). This focus on ley lines and dimension magic makes them, in effect, specialists in Rift and Ley Line Magic. A mastery of magic and knowledge that these mages see as a strength and that most Ley Line Walkers and other practitioners of magic regard as short-sighted and limiting.\n\nTeleportational Hitchhiking\nThe Ley Line Rifter is able to hitch a ride on any form of Teleportation, Rift, Dimensional Teleport/travel spell/ability or similar magic/effect, includes spells like Mystic Portal, Dimensional Portal, Swap Places, Teleport, etc., as well as a dragon's or demon's natural teleport ability, and so on. The Rifter will end up with the teleporter wherever he reap-pears. The only limitation is that the teleport must begin within range and line of sight of the Ley Line Rifter and that it costs 20 P.P.E. to hitch a ride with the teleporter. Note that the Rifter may be visible to the teleporter or hidden in some way. All that matters is that the Rifter has a clear visual contact with the teleporter, the person teleporting doesn't have to see him.\nRange: 100 feet (30.5 m); +20 feet (6.1 m) per level of experience. \nP.P.E.

The armor is often made from natural M.D.C. materials like the plates from a Fury Beetle or hide of a dinosaur, and interlaced with M.D. ceramic plates, padding and miracle fibers. M.D.C. metal alloys may be used but are kept to a minimum (less than 50%) because they interfere with the flow of P.P.E. and interfere with the ability to cast spells. Remember, the mage also has magic spells, such as Armor of Ithan, Impervious to Fire, etc., he can cast to provide additional protection for himself.

He can tell whether it is near or far and follow the feeling to the location of the Iey line. \nBase Skill: 30% +5% per each additional level of experience.\n\n• Sense Ley Line Nexus\nOnce the Iey line has been found, the walker can follow the Iey line to as many nexus points as it may have. A nexus point is where two or more ley lines cross/intersect. \nBase Skill: 40% +5% per each additional level of experience.\n\n• Sense a Rift\nThe mage will automatically feel the sensation of a Rift opening or closing anywhere within 50 miles (80 km) of him. Increase the sensing range 10 miles (16 km) per each additional level of experience starting with level two. Although he cannot tell exactly where this Rift is, the mage knows if it is near or far and whether it is big or small. Note: When actually on a ley line, the Line Walker will know exactly where the Rift is located and he can sense one wherever it is, as long as it is on the ley line or a connecting line. \n\n• Sense Magic in Use\nThe expenditure of magic in the form of a spell, Rifting, or Techno-Wizardry can be felt, if not seen, up to 100 feet (30.5 m) away per every level of the Line Walker's experience. The Ley Line Walker will not know the location nor be able to trace it, but he will feel its energy and know that magic is being used in the area of his sensing range. Note: This does not include the use of psionic powers. \n\n• See Magic Energy\nThe mage sees magic energy/P.P.E. radiating from people, creatures, objects, and areas, as a faint aura whenever more than 20 P.P.E. points are present. The sensing ability is so acute that the Ley Line Walker can see things made invisible by magic and invisible things that are magical, including invisible dragons and other creatures of magic. This special sight occurs only when the mage de-sires to use it and focuses on seeing the magically invisible. However, the effort uses up one melee attack/action per round (15 seconds) that this special sight is willed in place. Note: Does not work on the spell, Invisibility Superior.

If he teleports up into the air he can stay there suspended (+20% to Prowl/ hide, because us ground dwelling humans don't usually look up).

Engaging in conversation or combat, even self-defense, will break the concentration, forcing the mage to start over. The process requires ID4 melees (15 to 60 seconds) of concentration every time before the teleportation happens, so he can't just pop out in a heartbeat, but it's still very, very handy. The teleport is always on target, because the Ley Line Walker is one with the ley line. Of course, unless he can see his destination, he can't know who or what might also be present in that area and he could appear in the middle of an armed camp (but not inside one of them or a tree, etc., as is the dan-ger with the Teleportation spell).`,\n                note: `Ley Line Phasing is an automatic ability common to all Ley Line Walkers at NO P.P.E. cost, but it does take its toll on the body. The maximum number of phasings/teleports possible is four per hour. The per 24 hour period is 4 +2 per each level of experience (6 at level one, 8 at level two, IO at level three, etc). More than this is just impossible. The only other limitations are: 1) He can only teleport himself and his possessions, nobody else. 2) The location must be along the same ley line as if traveling on a mystic railway. To switch to a different ley line, the character must travel or teleport to the nexus point intersection •where two or more different ley lines cross paths to follow one of the other lines.`,\n                type: 'Occupational'\n            }\n\n        character.abilities.leyLineWalkingOrLineDrifting =\n            {\n                name: `Ley Line Walking or Line Drifting`,\n                description: `A Ley Line Walker can open himself to the ley line energies and walk or float through the air along the length of the ley line.

At the end of the trance he knows one of these spells (pick one). \nThere are two schools of thoughts about Rift & Ley line Magic. One is the typical Line Walker who feel Ley Line Magic is useful, but no more important or significant than any other spell invocation. And the smaller camp who feel Ley Line Magic is of significant and over-riding value. This second camp tends to be a silent minority, for they consider themselves to be elitists with unique and keen insights and whose focus make them special. These mages are Ley Line Rifters who focus on learning all the spells above and similar energy and dimension types of Invocations (described immediately after the Ley Line Walker O.C.C.). This focus on ley lines and dimension magic makes them, in effect, specialists in Rift and Ley Line Magic.

As a weapons, the rope and lasso is used to encircle the shoulders,arms, waist or feet to snare, trip and otherwise pin and incapacitate an opponent. The lasso can also ensnare the neck and strangle opponents.\n\nTrip Attacks: A successful roll to strike knocks the victim to the ground and they lose initiative and one melee attack/action. If the attacker is on horseback, in a vehicle, or super strong, they may pull or drag the victim.\n\nEntangle Attacks: A successful roll to strike ensnares the desired area of the body, typically the arm, upper torso, waist, leg, or foot. A subsequent successful roll to disarm or entangle may be then made.\n\nDisarm Attacks: After a successful Entangle Attack, a further successful roll to strike means the lasso is jerked in such a way that it slips off the victim's arm, but it takes whatever they were holding in that hand with it. 60% chance of knocking it to the ground, 61-100% chance the item is lassoed and can be pulled into the attacker's hand in two melee actions (four total attacks are used up: one to entangle the arm, one to disarm the arm, and two to pull the item).\n\nIncapacitate Attacks: After a successful Entangle Attack, a further successful roll to strike means the attacker can incapacitate that limb/part of the body (usually by pulling the rope and the lassoed limb taut), making it impossible for the victim to use it. If an arm or hand, the victim must use their other arm and hand (at half their usual bonuses and -1 melee attack unless they are ambidextrous).\n\nIf it is the foot or leg that is lassoed and incapacitated (pulled tight), the victim runs or hops at half speed, can not get away unless they can cut the rope, is -4 to dodge and roll with impact, and -1 to parry, disarm, or pull punch. Using s a second melee attack to jerk the lasso will knock the victim off their feet (losing initiative and one melee attack)and he can then be pulled/dragged by hand, horse, or vehicle, or hog-tied (costs the attacker two additional melee attacks/actions unless the victim can roll a 17 or higher to dodge the attacker succeeds without further incident. A roll of 17or higher enables the victim to squirm and move in such a way as to prevent being tied up and they can then engage the attacker in hand to hand combat).\n\nIf it is the upper body that is lassoed, it pins one arm to their body rendering it useless. The victim must use their other hand (at half their usual bonuses and -1 melee attack unless they are ambidextrous). A second lasso around the upper body (counts as another melee attack) pins both arms, leaving the victim unable to use their arms or hands. Trying to run while the arms are pinned is awkward and difficult, reduce the victim's speed by 20%, they are -2 to dodge and can not parry. No damage is inflicted, but the victim is physically incapacitated. Moreover, the lassoed individual can be pulled off their feet and knocked down (losing initiative and one melee attack/action) and can be quickly hog-tied by the attacker (counts as four melee attacks) or be dragged. Only one victim can be toped and pinned or hog-tied at a time.\n\nMultiple lassos can also be used to snare each limb and 'spread-eagle' the victim. The victim is physically helpless in this position. Only spell magic or psionics or other special attacks can be used when spread-eagled, arms pinned or completely hog-tied.\n\nStrangle Attack: Roping the neck can be sued to prevent the victim from speaking and makes them barely able to breathe (-1 attack per melee). Tightening the rope (counts as one melee attack) cuts the air supply off completely and strangles the victim unless they can cut themselves free or the attacker releases the victim by loosening and/or removing the lasso from around the neck. Depending on how long the victim can go without air, the victim may die. For most characters, dizziness occurs within 2 minutes (victim is -2 attacks per melee and -3 on all combat bonuses). Within 4 minutes the victim is rendered unconscious, unless they can hold their breath for an extraordinarily long time. If still on their feet, reduce their attacks and combat bonuses by half again. Within 2 or 3 minutes the victim will lapse into a coma and die within another 1D4 minutes. Note: A slow hanging kills the victim in half the time. A good character would never use a strangling attack to kill or hang, or stops short of causing coma and death. The strangling attack does NOT work on characters clad in power armour or full conversion cyborgs, or robots. Against a supernatural being or creature of magic, the attacker must have greater Supernatural Strength then the victim.\n\nEscaping a Lasso: Escape is possible if the victim is able to cut themselves free (provided they have a blade weapon or claws), shoot themselves free with a gun (first shooting the tow-line and then pulling the lasso from around their neck, counts as two melee attacks/actions), or pull themselves free if their P.S. is six points greater than their attacker.\n\nIt takes 1D4 melee actions to cut through an S.D.C. lasso with a S.D.C. knife, one action if an M.D. blade is used or the character has a Robotic or Supernatural P.S.. It is impossible, however, to draw a weapon and cut oneself loose if both arms are pinned or while being dragged. Of course, psionic or magical telekinesis or ectoplasm may be used to wield the blade, or some other extraordinary measure may be applicable (eye beam, bionic finger blaster, etc.).\n\nW.P.

They are drawn to war and love to offer their unique services to almost any conflict. Even though most love combat and proving themselves in battle, most have some form of honor. Their honorable reputation has only added value for many would-be employers. These beings can be found across the Megaverse serving as bounty hunters, bodyguards and assassins for hire.\n    What makes the Malvoren most desirable as hired guns are their natural combat skills and their incredible ability to meld with weapons and other war machines. The Malvoren possess natural abilities to meld with any type of weapon, body armor, exoskeleton, power armor, combat computer, weapon system, and even cybernetics and bionics. This process involves them actually merging with the weapon or machine, making its technology part of their living body. A body that is a collection of muscle like cords wrapped up in humanoid form, and able to un-wrap and fuse with the machines of war. Once fused with any type of armor, weapon, or other war machine, these fantastic beings can power, repair, and operate the machine as an extension of their own body with the speed of thought and reflex action. These beings are almost always seen encased and melded with full suits of heavy body armor and bionics or cybernetics. This integration of machine and bionic parts confuses many into mistakenly believing that the Malvoren are some form of living neural robot or advanced cyborg.\n    Although the Malvoren can bond with weapons and ma-chines - and love massive weapon systems on large military vehicles and starships - they usually prefer to merge with body armor and handheld weapons such as energy rifles, rail guns, etc. This is because they want to be the engine of their own war machine rather than pilot or run part of a larger vehicle or machine of mass destruction. It's part of their need to prove their skill and honor on the battlefield that makes them choose to fight this way. \n    Another part of their warrior honor code is to try and fight any honorable or worthy enemy with weapons equivalent to the ones possessed by their opponent. This means that if their opponent has melee weapons the Malvoren ann themselves them with the same or equivalent weapons to do battle. They never take down a worthy foe with a superior weapon, nor cheat in battle. However, an unworthy foe may be dealt with in any manner deemed expedient. Sometimes, these beings even un-meld from all of their weapons to engage a worthy opponent without weapons or equip him before they fight. In general, these alien warriors pride themselves on being capable and formidable combatants in any and all forms of combat. Despite a few psionic powers and the natural ability to meld with technology, Malvoren pride themselves on their physical prowess and fighting skills. \n    Malvoren are completely unable to understand or learn any form of magic, and this has given them a sense of disdain for those who use the mystic arts or magic weapons, as if using magic is cheating somehow. This dislike for magic is so drastic that they will NEVER pick up a magic weapon or meld with a Techno-Wizard weapon or devices even to save themselves. Al-though they are somewhat intrigued by Techno-Wizard devices, they find them to be perverse and unnatural forms of technology. \n    When not on the battlefield, a Malvoren can usually be found cleaning or tinkering with a weapon, upgrading his combat systems and looking for new work. They love to repair, upgrade, customize, and modify every weapon that crosses their path. These beings can repair, rebuild, and upgrade even weapons they are not merged with in half the normal time it would take an Operator. This affinity as a weapon mechanic alone has caused many warlords to seek out their services. \n    The Malvoren's innate understanding of mechanics extends to all machines, as they have a good understanding of the working of all machines as well as skills in mechanics and electronics. However, their grasp of mechanics and electronics and how it applies to machines that are not combat related, is somewhat less adept and of little interest to these warriors. Their mechanical skills are intuitive and based on combat and weapon technology. Malvoren avoid working on machines not designed for combat as they find them unimportant and uninteresting. When-ever they work on non-combat machines or non-combat related systems, they are very slow (takes at least twice as long as it should, probably longer), the quality of their work is always poor (slapped together good enough to get by), and they act as if they are being unfairly punished. They can, however, fix normal machines whenever they need to, and quickly if they want to. \n    Unfortunately for the Malvoren, the Splugorth have taken notice of their unique abilities. Because the Splugorth are super-natural monsters and purveyors of magic, the Malvoren refuse to work for them and, in fact, have frequently clashed with Sunaj and other Minions of Splugorth when hired by Splugorth rivals and enemies, which are many. In cruel retaliation, the Splugorth have found ways to lobotomize Malvoren and use them in Bio-Wizardry. The Malvoren have been turned into intuitive automated weapon control systems on many Splugorth battleships and other war machines. With the addition of Eyes of Eylor and Zembahk, these weapon systems require no operators and outperform systems that use a gunner or even the most advanced combat computer. Consequently, the Splugorth pay top dollar for these living weapon control systems and there is a standing bounty of one million credits per each Malvoren delivered to them alive. (Easier said than done.) \n    The Malvoren's nomadic pursuit of combat, life as soldiers, and being hunted by the Splugorth, have decreased their numbers over the years and made them a rare and valuable commodity throughout the Megaverse. One or more can be found around any major conflict working as mercenaries and assassins, but they usually avoid areas controlled by the Splugorth unless they have been hired to fight against them. In fact, the growing hatred for the Splugorth compels many Malvoren to offer their ser-vices with those embroiled in conflicts with the Splugorth. Sometimes, they'll even work for less than their going rate to get back at the evil monsters. \n    The Malvoren's origin and history is unknown, making them something of an enigma. Some have suggested the Splugorth actually created them, but this seems unlikely or the Splugorth would create more rather than hunt them. Others believe they may be supernatural in nature, though that too is a misnomer, Malvoren are mortal beings. The Malvoren themselves will only say that the Megaverse is their home, suggesting to many that they are an ancient race who have been wandering the Megaverse for so long that they no longer remember the birthplace of their race. Others wonder if they might have lost their home world in battle and that the Malvoren we know today are the descendants of the survivors. This might help explain their culture as warriors and assassins, and their lack of allegiance to any planet or people. \n    Malvoren are tall, muscular humanoids with small, black eyes that glow red then white in combat. They have no skin, and are composed of tendrils or cords of dark red muscle tissue. They have no visible mouth, nose, or ears (they are concealed by the muscle cords that wrap around the entire body, including the head and face), but they do need to eat, breathe and sleep as any other mortal being.\n\n(see Rifts® World Book 30: D - Bees of North America pg. 138 for more information)`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/race/malvoren.jpg';\n        this.availableOCCs = `A Malvoren does not get to choose an O.C.C. and must instead rely on R.C.C. skills and natural abilities.\n\nR.C.C.

On top of these bonuses, if the character is melded with any telescopic, laser, or other targeting systems, the bonuses from those systems are also added when using the melded weapon. \nWhen melded with multiple weapons, the character can fire link them together. This gives him the option to shoot with all fire-linked weapons simultaneously at the same target as one melee attack. \nDuration: It takes one melee action/attack for the character to meld with a weapon. Once the link has been established, it is maintained until the Malvoren decides to disconnect. A linked weapon feels as natural to the D-Bee as his own fingers and hands. \nP.P.E. Cost to Meld: 5 points per each item. \n\nMeld with Weapon Systems (special)\nThrough the same method of melding with weapons, the Malvoren can also merge with weapon systems, targeting computers, combat computers, radar/sensor clusters, turrets, etc. in any type of power armor, robot vehicle, tank or other combat vehicle, ship, spacecraft or weapon built into a fortification. Once bound to a weapon system the character and weapon system are one and he can control and use the system with its full bonuses and at a skill level of 95%. In addition to any standard bonuses that the weapon system may offer, the Malvoren 's meld enhances them and creates an unparalleled union, giving him an additional bonus of +2 to strike.\nDuration: Takes 2 melee actions to meld and can be maintained indefinitely.\nP.P.E. Cost: 8.\n\nMeld with Armor (special)\nThe same as weapon melding, only this is done with body armor, ideally a heavy suit of armor. This armor can even include cyborg armor, exoskeletons or a patchwork of M.D.C. plating, shielding or piece attached to the body to become a makeshift body armor (6D6+52 M.D.C. for patchwork armor). Note: Power armor is considered a War Machine; see below for details. \nOnce melded with armor, it becomes an extension of the character as if it were a living part of him, like an exoskeleton of an insect. When melded with any type of armor, its damage capacity is increased by 20% and conforms to the Malvoren 's body like a form-fitting glove. All prowl, strike, parry, dodge, or other penalties that the armor may im-pose on a normal wearer are reduced by half Furthermore, when the character is melded with a complete suit of armor, the P.S. becomes the equivalent of Robotic Strength and Mega-Damage is inflicted with his punches and kicks. \nDuration: It takes three melee actions/attacks to bond to armor. Once the meld is complete, the armor can be maintained in-definitely. \nP.P.E. Cost: 10. \n\nMeld with Cybernetics (special)\n With this strange power the character can meld with cybernetics and bionic weapons and parts as if they were snap-on pieces. No surgery is needed. The Malvoren simply places the bionic component where he wants it and it merges with his body. Cybernetics can be used to add to the D-Bee's body or even replace missing body parts by having those parts meld completely with his body. This can include any cybernetic internal organs, eyes, ears, arms, legs and weapons. Most Malvoren seek cybernetic eyes and other sensory implants, as all of their natural senses are poor. Malvoren seldom replace a natural limb with a bionic one, because they regrow lost limbs in a few days, but may use bionic limbs as additional appendages plugged into the body. Many Malvoren have extra arms or tentacles attached. In more extreme cases, some Malvoren have even melded their entire lower torso to a bionic type of vehicle or animal frame. When they are done with the vehicle lower body, they disconnect and regrow the legs and groin within seven days. \nThese beings can, of course, also meld with bionic and cybernetic weapons to create shoulder mounted weapons, fore-arm weapons, claws, and other types of common bionic weaponry. \nMelding with cybernetics and bionics is somewhat painful and does I D6 S.D.C. and I D4 Hit Points of damage when they meld with or un-meld with each artificial part. Full re-placement limbs or torso frames do three times as much damage, require triple the time to meld with, and cost three times the normal P.P.E. When the character un-melds with any cybernetics, the original organ or body part reforms as the cybernetic part is dispelled. Un-melding with a major cybernetic that has replaced a limb or an entire torso takes a full minute. \nDuration: Takes one melee round to meld and can be maintained indefinitely. \nP.P.E. Cost: 10. \n\nPower Weapons (special)\nAnother one of the Malvoren's phenomenal powers is the ability to power weapons the individual has joined to his body. By expending a few P.P.E. and, in some cases, a few S.D.C. or Hit Points, the D-Bee can recharge the energy cell or clip, or power any weapon. To charge an energy weapon the character simply channels some of his P.P.E. and converts it into conventional energy for that weapon. Because of the low amount of expendable P.P.E. that they usually have, and the high amount of P.P.E. it takes to charge weapons and E-Clips, the Malvoren usually choose to use energy and ammunition stored in conventional clips before powering the weapon themselves. They most often resort to powering a weapon themselves when faced with an enemy who is not vulnerable to conventional weapons so they may inflict damage on them. \nIf the weapon is a rail gun or other form of weapon that fires a slug or flechette, the character must convert some of his own flesh and bone into the projectile along with channeling P.P.E. to provide the weapon with ammunition. Projectiles that require chemicals or moving parts like bullets, grenades or missiles can NOT be recreated by this power. \nA strange side effect of damage from a weapon melded with and powered by the Malvoren is that it will harm creatures normally immune to conventional weapons. Any creature that can be harmed by magic or psionics will take full damage even if they are normally immune to that type of damage. This even includes beings like Vampires, Were-wolves, and even Cosmo-Knights! \nDuration: Instant; any charge to an energy cell or ammo created will last until it is used. P.P.E. \nCost: Varies. Standard E-Clip: 10 P.P.E., Long E-Clip: 15 P.P.E., Canister, FSE or similar type of energy cell: 25 P.P.E., Large Energy Cell like a backpack: 40 P.P.E. Directly powering a weapon costs 1 P.P.E. per die of damage, per shot or blast, and creating rail gun ammo costs 10 P.P.E and I D6 S.D.C. or Hit Points per slug, or 20 P.P.E. and 3D6 S.D.C. or Hit Points per flechette or burst. This also provides the power to fire a single shot or burst. \n\nHeal & Repair Weapons and Armor (special)\nOnce the Malvoren has melded with a weapon, armor, or other war machine, he can heal or repair it using his own body and P.P.E. This healing or repair cannot replace missing parts or add new ones, it can only rebuild and mend what is still there. Armor must still have 20% of its damage capacity or it is beyond the character's ability to heal it. \nDuration: One melee attack per 10 M.D.C. or S.D.C. healed; permanent. \nCost (Special): 1 P.P.E. and 1 S.D.C. or Hit Point per 1 S.D.C. restored, or 5 P.P.E. and 10 S.D.C. or Hit Points per 1 M.D.C. restored. \nNote: In addition to being able to transfer S.D.C. or Hit Points to armor or weapons as below, all weapons, cybernetics, or armor melded to the character heal 1D6 M.D.C. per hour. Only 1D6 M.D.C. total is healed between all items. Healing will usually first take place with cybernetics, then armor, and last with weapons. This automatic healing does not require any thought or energy, it just happens.\n\nMeld with War Machines (special)\nThis is the power to bond to and become one with any machine of war. Machines of war include any power armor, tank or other combat vehicle, robot vehicle, or fighter craft. Generally, the Malvoren prefers to meld with armor and handheld weapons to become an engine of war himself. Sometimes however, this is not enough firepower to get the job done. In these cases, the character may meld with any war machine, becoming one with every system in the vehicle or power armor. Once melded with a war machine the character has the equivalent of Pilot: Robot Combat Elite, Pilot: Tanks, Pilot: Fighter, Pilot: Patrol Boat, or equivalent appropriate skills for that vehicle at a proficiency four levels higher than his current level of experience. \nDuration: It takes one full melee round to meld, but may be maintained indefinitely. \nP.P.E. Cost: 15. \n\nMeld With Non-Combat Machines (special)\nAlthough rare for them to do so and painful, Malvoren can meld with machines that are not used for combat. Whenever the character melds with a non-combat machine, the melding inflicts 2D6 S.D.C. and I D6 Hit Points of damage. They also suffer this damage when they un-meld with the machine. Once melded with any type of machine, the character has a basic understanding of how to operate or pilot it at a level one proficiency. \nDuration: It takes one full melee round to meld, lasts 1D6 minutes per level of experience. \nP.P.E. Cost: 25. \n\nUn-Melding (special)\nUn-melding with each item takes only one melee action, with the exception of some cybernetics as mentioned above.\n\nVulnerabilities\nMalvoren have poor natural vision that can only see in the ultraviolet and infrared spectrums, and poor hearing. This is part of what attracts them to melding with cybernetic sensory implants. \n\nMelding Limitations\nOne of the biggest limitations of the melding powers is that whenever a Malvoren melds with a weapon, suit of armor, cybernetic system, or machine, he does not recover the P.P.E. spent on that melding or any physical damage taken by that melding until he un-melds with the item. After un-melding with an item, the D-Bee regains the P.P.E., S.D.C., and Hit Points used to originally meld with it at the normal rate of recovery (noted previously). A side effect that they suffer if they meld with too many items is the loss of non-Telemechanic psionic powers and 50% of the base I.S.P. This occurs when a Malvoren melds with enough cybernetics, weapons, and armor to become more than 50% machine. To become more than fifty percent machine, a Malvoren must meld with four or more additional/replacement limbs along with four cybernetics, meld with a cyborg torso and four cybernetics, or 12 or more cybernetic items of any type, or meld with more than 12 total weapons plus cybernetics and/or armor. This is generally what should constitute 50% machine, but it may take more or less than these numbers of melding, as the Game Master sees fit.`;\n        this.magicDesc = `None; Malvoren have no magic potential and cannot even use Techno-Wizardry items, despite being psychic.`;\n        this.cyberneticsDesc = `Starts off with up to 1D4 cybernetic implants and may have one bionic limb (additional limb or replacement melded with an original) with up to two weapon systems.

The strongest emotions are easiest to sense; hate, anger, terror, love. Feeling for emotions can often be used to establish that somebody or something is nearby, but can NOT be used to pinpoint an invisible or hiding per-son/ creature. Empathy can be especially helpful in recognizing and communicating with ghosts and other supernatural creatures.\n    Questioning a person/being while using Empathy can be very handy in establishing how they are reacting to you. In a limited sense, Empathy can be used like a lie detector to see if the emotions match the verbal response. For Example: \"Did you know the deceased')\" The verbal answer is no, but there is a sudden flare of nervousness and fear (or hate). This doesn't mean the guy is the killer, but it might mean he is lying about knowing the dead man. Further questions might pull out a strong emotion such as anger or hate (or happiness), which may con-firm the psychic's suspicions that this man might be involved in the murder. However, remember that this is, at best, circumstantial evidence and definitely inadmissible in court. Physical proof must be found, hut the empathic readings may put characters on the right track. Also, remember that the empathic psychic is feeling the person's real emotions, hut interpreting their significance. A very nervous person may always radiate fear or anxiety, while a cold-blooded, pathological killer may feel nothing at all and stay calm and cool as he lies through his teeth. The feeling of hate may mean that the person did know the murder victim, or knew of him, and hated him for any number of rea-sons. That does not mean he killed him. As you can sec, interpreting emotions can be a tricky thing. \n    Haunting Ghosts and Entities rarely mask their emotions. Thus, the psychic can easily tell if one or more is nearby (within 100 feet/30.5 m) and what it is feeling, “I sense great sorrow.\" or \"Do as it says! It is angry, almost crazed. I think it will carry out its threat if you try to stop it.\"\n`;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Empathy;","const Spell = require('../Spell');\n\nclass ImplosionNeutralizer extends Spell {\n

(Solid):12 I.S.P.';\n        this.description = `    This mystifying ability enables the psychic to create a slightly luminous, vapor-like substance that is exuded from the pores. Ectoplasm has two forms: an invisible vapor and a luminous, solid state. \n    The vapor is a sort of floating, probing finger that can snuff out candles, open doors, knock over or pick up small objects (weighing under 9 ounces/255 grams), tap somebody on the shoulder, rustle leaves and knock on a door. The Ectoplasmic vapor can be seen only by its creator, psychics and supernatural beings who can see the invisible, or with infrared optic systems (including infrared camera lenses, infrared gun sights, binoculars, etc.). Ectoplasm, although an invisible vapor, has physical properties, which means it cannot go through walls or solid objects. Thus, a person walking into an ectoplasm stream may feel a slight sensation, like walking into a spider's web or brushing against a cotton ball. Often a person will unwittingly walk into and snag the stream of floating ectoplasm, pulling or stretching it along without being aware of it. In such cases, the psychic must maneuver the snagged portion to loop around the human obstruction. The creator of the vapor can control the full length of the vaporous stream like a floating tentacle. Although the vapor cannot go through solid objects it can slip through keyholes, cracks under doors or loose seals around a window. If a breeze can blow through, so can ectoplasm. The only drawback is that the psychic must be able to see the ectoplasm to maneuver it. \n    The solid state of ectoplasm can be a startling sight. In this form the ectoplasm can be shaped into an extra limb, such as an arm and hand, or just a hand or tentacle, or even a foot attached to a long stream spooling out of the psychic. The Ectoplasmic limb appears as a white, slightly luminous appendage connected to a trail of ectoplasm stretching back to its creator like a life-line of silly putty. The appendage and its connecting line can hover, float, levitate and fly (at a speed of I 8). The solid ectoplasmic limb has much greater strength and is able to carry, lift or hold up to 40 lbs. (18 kg), but cannot squeeze through the tiny openings that the vapor can. An opening must be at least the size of a quarter for solid ectoplasm to fit, and then the limb must be turned into a thin tentacle and reformed on the other side of the opening. Ecto-plasm can also be used to create a face or even a full figure, although detailed features are impossible. Ectoplasmically created images may explain apparitions reported during some seances.\n\nEcto-Combat:\n    The ectoplasm vapor and solid form both have an automatic dodge against all attacks directed at any of its length. That means an attempt to hack the middle of the ectoplasmic stream will see that portion of the ectoplasm suddenly swerve, loop or bend with a life of its own to avoid the attack. The dodge by the mid-section (or any-where else) does not count as a melee action by the ecto-appendage. Moreover, the ectoplasm's creator can direct the appendage to hit back or pick up and use a weapon. The solid ectoplasm appendage is not a great tool for combat, however. It limits its creator's attacks/actions per melee and has minimal strength; equal to about a P.S. attribute of 4. A punch or kick does a mere one point of Hit Point/S.D.C. damage. Damage can be increased by the appendage using any type of hand-held weapon weighing under 40 lbs. (18 kg) and less than five feet (1.5 m) long. Small modern weapons, such as an energy pistol or revolver, can be used, but are -IO to strike. Meanwhile, the vapor cannot use any weapons weighing more than 9 ounces and can inflict no damage of its own. \n    A vapor or solid appendage must be controlled by its creator at all times (except the automatic dodge); thus, it has a number of attacks/actions equal to its creator. So, if the psychic has four attacks per melee, the ectoplasm appendage also has four attacks. However, each attack/ action by the ectoplasm counts as one of its creator's actions for that melee round.\n\nEcto-Combat Statistics:\n• Vapor and solid get an automatic dodge against all attacks, including multiple or simultaneous attacks.\n• +5 to dodge; applies to vapor and solid.\n• + 1 to parry; applies to vapor and solid. \n• + 1 to strike; applies to vapor and solid. \n• Vapor inflicts no physical damage, but can touch, tap or pick up and carry objects weighing 9 ounces or less. \n• Solid ectoplasm inflicts one point of damage in combat or by weapon. \n• Attacks or actions per melee are equal to its creator's. A pair of ectoplasmic limbs will divide the attack between the two equally. \n• Astral S.D.C. is 40 plus one Hit Point. Applies to vapor and solid. If the ectoplasm is destroyed the creator takes one Hit Point and I 0 S.D.C. points of physical damage.\n• Sunlight or bright artificial light (250 watts) reduces the range to half. \n• Maximum range possible for vapor and solid is 40 feet plus 5 feet per level of experience (12.2 m + 1.5 m per level). \n• One full melee (15 seconds) is required to create an ectoplasm vapor or solid appendage. Half a melee (7 seconds) is needed to with-draw/return ectoplasm into its creator.\n`;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Ectoplasm;","const Spell = require('../Spell');\n\nclass Ironwood extends Spell {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.name = 'Ironwood';\n        this.group = 'Invocation';\n        this.level = 'Twelve';\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Ironwood;","const Psionic = require('../Psionic');\n\nclass GroupMindBlock extends Psionic {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.name = 'Group Mind Block';\n        this.group = 'Super';\n        this.range = '120 feet (36.6 m).';\n        this.duration = '10 minutes per level of experience.';\n        this.cost = '22 I.S.P.';\n        this.description = `    The Master Psionic can instantly erect a mental barrier or Mind Block to protect himself and those around him, with in a 120 foot (36.6 m) area.

The attacker, and only the attacker(s), is struck and blinded by a burst of brilliant, pulsing light, as if a dozen flash bulbs with the light intensity of the sun suddenly went off in rapid succession. Only the would-be attacker sees the light and is affected by it, so those around him will be unaware of any magic or even that the attacker has been afflicted by magic, unless they can sense or see magic energy. Furthermore, the light frequency magically adjusts to the spectrum of light by which the attacker sees, so it is effective against most life forms. (Note: It is not effective against those rare beings who use psionics, feelers, sense of smell and/or other senses to see/identify their victims and surroundings, including the Splugorth' s Altaran Blind Warrior Women.)\n    The victim of the magical light pulses is temporarily blinded for 1D4 melee rounds, making him - 1 0 to strike, parry and dodge, as well as -4 on initiative and loses one melee attack/action each round he is blinded. Furthermore, his impaired vision makes it impossible for the character to read, he can not move faster than a speed of 8 without stumbling and falling (loses initiative and two melee actions per each fall), and any attempt to perform a skill is done as if blind, with a skill penalty of -80%.\n\n    Further Notes:\n1.

The light is magical and will penetrate non-magical armor and visors, so even characters in environmental body armor or power armor will suffer its effects.

In this case, 50 man-sized people (or equivalently fewer, large objects, vehicles or creatures) per level of the spell caster can enter a small Rift to a limbo realm of white mist and clouds. Once all have entered, the portal closes and those who entered seem to disappear. There is no trace of these troops or objects and no sensors can detect them because they no longer exist in our world. The creation and entry to the Rift must be done at a ley line nexus, but once all have entered and the portal is closed, it can be placed to reopen anywhere along any ley line connected to the nexus.\n    The passage of time for those in limbo is warped, so for every one hour that passes in the real world outside, it only seems like 1D4 minutes to those waiting in limbo.\n    This spell is ideal for setting up ambushes and surprise attacks. Spell casters love to lead an enemy into a seemingly innocent and unoccupied location and then reopen the Rift to Limbo with a verbal command to spring the trap and release the troops waiting inside. Likewise, a character may trick an enemy into pitching their camp, searching for treasure, or lingering nearby long enough for some pre-set time in which the Rift will open and the enemy will be overwhelmed. When the Rift does reopen, it is the cue for all those within the limbo realm to exit. Slowpokes and those reluctant or unable to leave under their own power are magically deposited from limbo at the nexus point. Unsuspecting troops and travelers can suddenly face a small army of dozens to hundreds where none had stood just a moment before (several Rifts to Limbo can be strategically placed on the same ley line). This is yet another reason CS troops have learned to steer clear of ley lines and nexus points.\n    Note that when the Rift is first opened, it is comparatively small. However, even unwitting troops will see and recognize it for what it is and avoid it. The point is, enemy troops can not be tricked into entering the Rift and being held captive inside for hours.

They are usually versed in survival skills and proficient in a wide range of science, technical, mechanical and electrical skills. In many cases, they look more like your average Headhunter than a scientist. These men and women suffer from an insatiable lust for knowledge that drives them into the wastelands and wilderness, digging through ruins to unearth pre-Rifts artifacts and technology and trying to explain magic, the Rifts, time, dimensional travel, and rediscovering humankind's past. They explore the ruins of toppled cities and study the habits and physiology of creatures from the Rifts. \n        Far from the Coalition States, they are highly regarded as men of science and learning. They are a welcome and, sometimes, desperately needed addition to most adventurer groups, mercenary companies, and wilderness towns. Yet these rugged explorers of our future Earth are frequently feared by superstitious wilderness folk and by the average people of the CS. Coalition propaganda has painted these Rogues as mad scientists who care about science and knowledge above the safety of people. Reckless fools who toy with alien technology and flirt with disaster. Rumor has it that Rogue Scientists and Rogue Scholars cavort with all manner of alien beings, monsters, and worse. They also dare to enter forbidden places and hell-spawned dimensions where no god-fearing man would set foot. All propaganda from the Coalition States that fuels the flames of fear and superstition. The illiterate are constantly bombarded by talk, radio and video telecasts about insane or rebellious rogues who threatened the sanctity of the city or who support alien life over human. Reports frequently offer an inflammatory statement like, \"Only the demented mind of a Rogue Scientist (or Scholar) could have conceived of anything so diabolical.\" Or \"Several books were found among the assailant's possessions, obviously the source of his delusions.\" Or warnings like, \"Remember, these self-proclaimed men of science are liars and pawns of alien forces. Report any suspicious activity to the authorities at once! The life you save may be your own!\" \n        The Coalition intentionally paints a scary picture of the Rogue Scientist, because its leaders fear their knowledge. The Coalition knows all too well the power of pre-Rifts and alien technology, and a curious mind. They are concerned that if left unhampered, these scientists may disrupt CS society and affect the status quo. To the CS, these characters are indeed rogues who question everything they see and seek answers and truths the CS would rather not have revealed. Independent and strong in body and mind, these independent crusaders are not the sheep that typifies the average CS citizen. They are wolves among the sheep. Wolves who, by their words and actions, may show the sheep how to step out of their roles and question their masters. And that is not an acceptable contingency. Thus, they are vilified, discredited and branded dangerous enemies of the States. \n        An inventive and resourceful scavenger, the Rogue Scientist combines all levels of knowledge and technology to his area of expertise. Some are practically Operators with expertise in mechanics and technology, others study genetics, physiology and zoology, some are naturalists and explorers, and still others study a little bit of everything.\n            \n(seeRifts® Ultimate Edition pg. 95 for more information)`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/occ/RogueScientist.jpg';\n        this.raceDesc = `None, at least 35% are D-Bees.`;\n        this.reqIq = 12;\n        this.recommendedAttributes = `*( a high ME and PE are helpful but not mandatory. )`;\n        this.iqBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.perceptionBonus = { bonus: 4 };\n        this.insanityBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.diseaseBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.sdc = { sides: 6, amount: 1, bonus: 6 };\n        this.credits = { sides: 6, amount: 1, multiplier: 1000 };\n        this.blackMarketItems = { sides: 6, amount: 3, multiplier: 1000 };\n\n        this.occSkillsList = `Literacy in two Languages of choice (+ 35%). \nLanguage: Native Tongue at 96%. \nLanguage: Other: Three of choice (+20%). \nAstronomy & Navigation (+20%) \nBasic and Advanced Math (both+ 30%) \nBasic Electronics (+20%) \nComputer Operation (+20%) \nFind Contraband (+10%) \nPilot Automobile (+10%)\nRadio: Basic (+10%) \nRecycle (+20%) \nSalvage (+20%) \nW.P.

A mechanical and electrical whiz-kid who can fix just about anything that has gears and wires. As such, they are always a welcome sight in any community and are treated with respect and admiration. An Operator rarely has to pay for his own meals or a bed to lay on. Of course, the proprietor or town council may have some little repair job that they'd like him to do for a reasonable fee. There are no set fees for a particular job, so the fee and currency changes from place to place. Repairing an irrigation system at a wealthy town may mean 30,000 in credits, at a poor town payment may be a hot meal, a broken-down horse, and some basic supplies.\nRemember, while pre-Rifts machines and technology are in use, there are few individuals who fully understand how they work. Consequently, they cannot successfully maintain and repair them. The Coalition charges highly for their services. Often the price includes an oath of fealty to a Coalition State, binding the community to it financially and obligating the town to perform certain services, or provide goods, or to support the CS. This is how the Coalition increases its power base and territory, slowly absorbing the smaller communities around them. The next step is official union with a Coalition State, usually in ex-change for military protection, economic support, even better technical aid, and forgiving one's previous debt. Of course, once this happens, the Coalition sends in its advisors and makes the town conform to its standards, rooting out magic users, seizing all books and historical documents, and eliminating dangerous dissidents. Consequently, the Operator represents the only means for many small communities to maintain their independence. They are also the only people outlaws and undesirables, like adventurers and men at arms, can consult to get their gear, 'bots and vehicles repaired, modified or improved. \nAlthough the Operators have no formal organization or guild, they are an unofficial class within the civilized human societies of the Americas, similar to the Freemasons of old. They have no leader, no gathering place, nor doctrine to which all Operators adhere. Instead, they are a loose knit group of like-minded men and women who share a love and knowledge of machines and forgotten science. How Operators came to be is not exactly known. Most will tell you that some of those who survived the Coming of the Rifts also saved many of the old secrets. These secrets were handed down from father to son, generation to generation, until today. Indeed, if there is any common thread among Operators, it is secrecy. They will not share their knowledge with any-body except a fellow Operator, relative, or an apprentice. \nAs a rule, an Operator tends to disguise the extent of his knowledge with false modesty and cryptic talk about the Time of Man or Time Be-fore the Rifts, and ancient secrets. In reality, the character is as knowledgeable about modern, high-tech engineering as any Coalition engineer. Furthermore, their love of mechanics keeps them looking and learning more. These characters love their work and take fanatical pride in their craft. They are hard workers, inventive, and resourceful.\n\n(see Rifts® Ultimate Edition pg. 91 for more information)`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/occ/Operator.jpg';\n        this.raceDesc = `None.

Like the Body Fixer and Rogue Scientist, he or she is frequently a rugged, physically fit explorer and keeper of knowledge. He too is an enemy of the Coalition States and a \"traitor to humanity,\" but is ranked at the top of the list. Also known as truth seekers, Rogue Scholars dig through facts and information to find and reveal the truth on all subject matters. This makes them outspoken opponents of the Coalition States (\"rebels\" ac-cording the CS). Far worse, and making them far more dangerous than other men of science, Rogue Scholars teach the illiterate masses and D-Bees the truths they know as well as mathematics, reading and writing. Rogue Scholars love ideas and try to instill in everyone they encounter such virtues as keeping an open mind, being curious, asking questions, freedom of speech and expression, tolerance to new ideas and cultures, and seeking wisdom and truth. These things make the Scholar the most dangerous of the Rogues. Science is confusing and intimidating to most people, medicine and cybernetics a rare talent and beyond the average person's grasp, but the Rogue Scholar is just an ordinary person armed with words and ideas anyone can understand. They connect with people on a visceral level and are identified with as one of their own. To give their words even greater impact and validity, Rogue Scholars frequently possess forbidden artifacts from the past. Terrible objects such as books, photographs, artwork, recordings, film, and other things that reflect the ideology and goals from the vaunted ''Golden Age of Man.\" And Erin Tarn stands as the figurehead of all that is good about this profession and their quest for truth (making her CS Public Enemy Number One).\n    Simply instilling uneducated people with curiosity and teaching them how to read for themselves undermines the Coalition's carefully executed plan to keep its citizens and backwoods people illiterate, un-educated, and complacent. A curious mind will always ask questions and ultimately challenge the authority before it when those questions are not satisfactorily answered. Something the powers-that-be dislike. \n    Though they would never admit it, the Coalition leaders respect the scholars and scientists who dare to pursue and teach knowledge and truth, knowing full well that it may cost them their lives. The Coalition also recognizes that these men and women may have uncovered knowledge that could be vital to the CS. Remember, while the Coalition States promotes ignorance among its citizens, its political network, military elite, and own scientists are extremely well educated. As a rule, rogues are captured and interrogated. A cooperative individual who comes to sincerely realize that he was \"misguided\" and his actions potentially detrimental to (the Coalition's) human civilization may be released or asked to join the CS as one of their operatives (though prob-ably never a full citizen). Those too independent to accept such an offer or too stubborn to share anything with the CS will be imprisoned for ID6x 10 years. The most notorious and defiant rogues will have their knowledge painfully extracted during a period of imprisonment that could be a matter of weeks or years, before being executed as terrorists. \n    Rogue Scholars tend to be charismatic, socially adept, clever, resourceful, and given to thinking before they act. This can make for the beginnings of a good strategist, tactician, and diplomat as well as motivational speaker and teacher. Notorious collectors, Rogue Scholars adore books, artwork, film, television, and mementoes from the past. Consequently, they often accumulate large collections of new, reprinted and pre-Rifts books, video discs, art, statues, nicknacks, and artifacts from bottle caps and silverware to pop culture and technology. True pre-Rifts artifacts may be worth hundreds to thousands of credits on the Black Market, and a death sentence if apprehended by Coalition forces. The problem is that the scholar can seldom bear to sell the precious items and his hideout will be filled with them. Ah, the price of knowledge and art.\n    \n(see Rifts® Ultimate Edition pg. 93 for more information)`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/occ/RogueScholar.jpg';\n        this.raceDesc = `None; at least 40% are D-Bees.`;\n        this.alignment = `Any, but tends to be Good or Unprincipled.`;\n        this.reqIq = 10;\n        this.reqMa = 10;\n        this.recommendedAttributes = `*( a high M.E. is helpful but not mandatory. )`;\n        this.iqBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.maBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.perceptionBonus = { bonus: 5 };\n        this.sdc = { sides: 6, amount: 2 };\n        this.credits = { sides: 6, amount: 2, multiplier: 100 };\n        this.blackMarketItems = { sides: 6, amount: 3, multiplier: 1000 };\n\n        this.occSkillsList = `Literacy: Native Language (+50%)\nLiteracy: Other: Three of choice (+30%)\nLanguage: Speaks Native Language at 98%\nLanguage: Other: Two of choice (+25%)\nAppraise Goods (+20%)\nBasic Math (+25%)\nComputer Operation (+20%)\nComputer Programming (+15%)\nCreative Writing (+15%)\nFind Contraband (+15%)\nHistory: Pre-Rifts (+22%)\nHistory: Post-Apocalypse (+20%)\nPublic Speaking (+20%)\nResearch (+30%)\nPilot: Automobile or Hover Vehicle (+10%)\nW.P.

Some are just ordinary people who get swept up in the flow of events or decide that it is time they make a change in their Jives. Others are individuals who possess some natural power (psionics or racial ability), but do not have great training or education other than in the use of their powers. These folks tend to take low-end jobs or drift from place to place, and job to job. Vagabonds are the ultimate Bohemians of this group. They actually like the freedom of not being tied down and drifting along from one adventure to the next. They put their trust in fate and make the best of every situation. Vagabonds are laid-back, easygoing and friendly. They like to travel, like meeting new people, like trying new things (even if it's baling hay or chopping wood), and like not having to worry about supporting a family or answering to anybody but themselves. For a Vagabond, each new face is a welcomed encounter, each new place an opportunity for adventure, even if it's on a small, personal scale. \"See, I didn't know that,\" and \"oh, how interesting,\" are words anyone traveling with a Vagabond is likely to hear over and over again. \n    Those who choose the life of a Vagabond are usually spirited individuals full of life and curiosity, but rarely very educated in any formal sense, nor literate, and seldom seek higher education. They tend to live by the seat of their pants and rely on their wits, luck, and the kindness of strangers.

The rope/lariat can be used on cattle, horses, and even small dinosaurs and alien animals similar to cattle. This skill with a lariat can be executed standing on solid ground or while in motion. In fact, it is designed and intended to be done from horseback (or hovercycle) whilst moving.\n\nA successful skill roll means the animal is caught in the lasso,usually ensnared by the horns, neck, a foot or leg, held tight and unable to run or pull away. Once ensnared, the cowboy can exercise any of the manoeuvres mentioned above, from pinning and tying up the animal up to controlling it and leading it back to the herd or holding pen.\n\nA failed skill roll to lasso an animal or stationary target means it misses its mark, or hits but slips off with no effect.`;\n        this.bonus = `+1 Entangle at levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14.\n+10% Roping if Cowboy or Saddle Tramp O.C.C.

The years of life in the outdoors means the individual is powerfully built, conditioned to harsh climates and environments and tough as nails.

A failed skill roll means the trail cannot be followed by others as intended. \nBase Skill: 20% +5% per level of experience.\n\nCross-Country Pacing\nWilderness Scouts are known for pacing themselves for cross-country travel. This not only includes pacing their physical exertion and speed, but also pacing their food and water in-take, enabling them to cover great distances on foot, horseback or by mountain bicycle for maximum speed at a pace that can be maintained for days. This skill combined with Land Navigation also enables them to accurately predict how long a trip will take (for them alone or with others in tow - the latter always taking twice as long) within 2D6x10 minutes, 6D6 hours if unfamiliar with the area. \nThis makes the Wilderness Scout an excellent messenger between parties, able to cut across country avoiding roads and other well trafficked areas, in favor of little known back roads, hunting trails, water-ways and short cuts, often ensuring secrecy and safety for the travel. (Note: A Scout never reveals his most secret and favorite routes to clients or strangers accompanying him unless it is an absolute emergency.) These guys come and go without anyone knowing how, when or where they've been. Once a Scout travels out of sight, he seems to simply vanish into the wilderness. \nOn a bicycle, this skill enables the Wilderness Scout to achieve three times his running speed on level ground, and travel cross-country at twice normal running speed. They can maintain this maximum bike speed for a time equal to their P.E.x10 in minutes without overexerting themselves. On foot, this skill enables the character to move at full run-ning speed cross-country for a time equal to his P.E.x5 in minutes with-out overexerting himself. \nBase Skill: 35% +5% per level of experience. \n\nCartography\nThe specialized art of mapmaking, Cartography is one of the most important skills that a Wilderness Scout learns. Characters with this skill can produce highly accurate maps with a wide variety of tools, including pen and paper, computer plotting and even advanced holographic displays. (Computer mapping requires a character to ha e the Computer Operation skill.) \nThe cartography skill also includes the rudiments of mathematics. A character with the Cartography skill has the equivalent of the Basic Math skill at a fixed base of 50%, plus any applicable bonus for an exceptional I.Q. attribute, or provides a bonus of +5% to Math: Basic if it is also selected as an O.C.C. Related Skill. \nA successful roll means the map is not only accurate and easy to use, but elegant and aesthetically pleasing. A failed roll indicates that some details are wrong, other details have been left out, and the scale and specified locations are off by 1D10 miles. \nBase Skill: 40% +5% per level of

This skill combined with Land Navigation also enables them to accurately predict how long a trip will take (for them alone or with others in tow - the latter always taking twice as long) within 2D6x10 minutes, 6D6 hours if unfamiliar with the area. \nThis makes the Wilderness Scout an excellent messenger between parties, able to cut across country avoiding roads and other well trafficked areas, in favor of little known back roads, hunting trails, water-ways and short cuts, often ensuring secrecy and safety for the travel.

It is often available only through underworld sources like the Black Market and independent entrepreneurs. In fact, the Black Market dominates the bionics and cybernetics markets, so there are seldom any industry standards for quality. The buyer gets whatever service and quality is available to him at the time. Horror stories abound about bionic Body-Chop-Shops that are more like butcher shops, and give the Cyber-Doc profession a bad reputation. \n    In the broadest sense of the word, a Cyber-Doc is any doctor, surgeon, or scientist who specializes in cybernetics and/or bionics. How-ever, the term \"Cyber-Doc\" has come to refer to the notorious underworld figure found in the Downside, 'Burbs and underworld of most cities and mercenary outposts. A character who is, all too often, a self-serving illegal doctor who works outside the law for his own profit.\n    The Cyber-Doc is a cybernetics specialist who offers his illegal ser-vices on the Black Market, not unlike the old abortion clinics of 1950s and 60s America. The Doc can be well-trained, well-meaning, and professional, or he can be an opportunist and/or a butcher. Since the operations are illegal, the patient has little say about the success or failure of the surgery. Medical treatment and authorized bionics is generally re-served for the military, political leaders, and the wealthy. Comparable cybernetics and bionics for the underprivileged are available at Black Market clinics and are always seem to be in unbelievably high demand. This demand is what has spawned the cut-rate, Black Market clinics known as \"Body-Chop-Shops.\" Filthy, crude facilities operated by the most nefarious underworld malefactors one can find. \n    The proprietors of these \"Chop-Shops\" pay fair prices (20% to 40% of list) for cybernetics and bionic \"parts\" and components - no questions asked. This has led to the creation of gruesome criminals known as Cyber-Snatchers. Fiends who attack, and steal bionics and cybernetics, pulling and chopping the artificial limbs or implants out of their victim for resale at a Body-Chop-Shop. Perhaps needless to say, the victim is usually maimed or killed in the process. \n    On the flip side, not all Cyber-Docs are evil or butchers. True professionals are experts in cybernetics and surgical wizards able to blend flesh and machine into something amazing. The Cyber-Doc player character is, presumably, one of the good guys. A healer who uses his unique gifts and knowledge to help the less fortunate and to empower freedom fighters, mercenaries or adventurers with muscles of steel. The Cyber-Doc is versed in all aspects of cybernetics, skin grafting, organ transplant, artificial organ replacement, robot prosthetics, cybernetic implants, and bionics, as well as internal medicine, neurology, and cybernetic theory and mechanics. The focus on cybernetics is surgery and grafting, so the Cyber-Doc is an expert surgeon, but not so good as a general practitioner or in recognizing and treating more mundane disease, illnesses and minor injury (no O.C.C. bonus to Medical Doctor skill). But ask him to replace a lost limb with a bionic one, or a heart or eye, and he can do it in record time with no complications. His expertise in cybernetics means he can also remove and install all forms of cybernetic and bionic devices, as well as work on the machine parts, to service, clean, repair and even build them from scratch, provided he has the right parts and access to the proper facility and equipment; even a Body-Chop-Shop or mechanic's garage will do. \n    A Cyber-Doc is part mechanic, part surgeon and part medical doc-tor. Someone who can help the crippled to walk, the blind to see and maimed to feel whole again. Cyber-Docs who treat D-Bees are black-listed and marked for death as \"traitors to humanity\" by the Coalition States, just like the Body Fixer. Since he's already a wanted man, many Cyber-Docs deal in stolen Coalition bionics and encourage raids on CS facilities. However, more often than not, the bionics are secondhand (don't ask), acquired from a mere, bandit or adventurer, or as a deal at a Black Market Body-Chop-Shop. Reputable Cyber-Docs often offer their services to the Black Market in exchange for bionics and cybernetics at wholesale prices (50% below list price). \n    A Cyber-Doc may be an independent operative or hooked up with a medical team, mercenary outfit, adventure group, or freelance for a town or army. Like the Body-Fixer, the Cyber-Doc is usually considered a rogue, malcontent and outlaw by the CS. However, to those in the wastelands, the Cyber-Doc (or any man of medicine) is a miracle worker and a godsend. Note: In the aftermath of Tolkeen's fall, Cyber-Docs are in high demand to give the maimed and injured a new lease on life via cybernetic medicine. The Coalition Army knows this, and has made a point to track down rebel field hospitals and gun down all \"criminals and rebels consorting with the enemy\" along with the D-Bee enemy.\n\n(see Rifts® Ultimate Edition pg. 89 for more information)`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/occ/CyberDoc.jpg';\n        this.raceDesc = `None; about 30% are D-Bees.`;\n        this.reqIq = 11;\n        this.reqPp = 12;\n        this.recommendedAttributes = `*( a high M.E. is also helpful but not mandatory. )`;\n        this.meBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.ppBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.painBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.diseaseBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.poisonBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.drugsBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.horrorBonus = { bonus: 4 };\n        this.credits = { sides: 6, amount: 4, multiplier: 1000 };\n\n        this.occSkillsList = `Literacy in Native Language (+40%).\nLanguage : Native Tongue at 96%.\nLanguage : Other: One of choice (+20%).\nAdvanced Mathematics (+10%)\nBasic Mathematics (+30%)\nBasic Mechanics (+20%)\nBasic Electronics (+15%)\nBiology (+20%)\nChemistry (+10%)\nComputer Operation (+5%)\nFind Contraband (+10%)\nMedical Doctor\nCybernetic Medicine (+10%)\nPathology (+10%)\nW.P.

That latter distinction makes the Body Fixers criminals, rogues and dissidents in the eyes of the Coalition States. Anybody caught \"harboring, aiding and abetting a criminal of the State\" - a distinction given to all D-Bees for not having been born human - is punishable by death! And that includes providing them with medical aid. Better to let a D-Bee die in the gutter than give \"it\" comfort or aid. \n    Body Fixers are doctors who cannot tum their backs on the sick and injured based on their race. A choice that has branded them as \"traitors to humanity\" by the CS. \n    Conservative estimates suggest the D-Bee population among sentient (intelligent) life forms in North America is 34%. Less conservative numbers place the number at closer to 42%. Most Rogue Scholars and Scientists believe a more accurate number is probably 50-55%. Perhaps all the more reason for human supremacists like the leaders of the Coalition States to want D-Bees dead. Even in the Chi-Town 'Burbs, where being caught by CS Police, soldiers and undercover agents is death for D-Bees, they make up an estimated 16% to 22% of the population! In the New West, D-Bees make up at least 60% to 80% of the population, in the east and north into Canada that number is probably 40%-50%, possibly higher, and that does not include Psi-Stalkers, who the CS considers to be mutant humans. \n    It is difficult to determine exact numbers because most D-Bees live in poverty or low-tech communities in thousands of tiny villages, towns and tribes. Gathering in a large community, especially within view of the CS, is to invite a Coalition extermination squad to come knocking. Likewise, because humans are the dominant power in North America and D-Bees second class citizens at most places that accept them, predominantly D-Bee communities are raided and attacked with impunity by other D-Bees and human meres, raiders, bandits and adventurers. D-Bees only have rights if they have the firepower to fight back, which many do not. And because the Coalition States have been so tenacious at breaking down and wiping out large gatherings of D-Bees before they can tum into full-fledged cities or kingdoms, most D-Bees have adopted the practice of trying to integrate (and lose) themselves into an established, predominantly human community where the CS is much less likely to attack. \n    However one cuts the numbers, they are far too many people for a dedicated healer to ignore. Furthermore, because D-Bees are, generally, forced to live in substandard conditions, abused, and refused conventional medical treatment, they need someone like the Body Fixer more than anyone.\n    As a result, Body Fixers are tough adventurers who often make house calls up to 300 miles ( 480 km) away from their base of operation. Around half are traveling doctors who may follow a regular circuit of towns, farms, homesteads and stops, or hook up with a group of adventurers, helping them and those in need encountered along the way. Consequently, most Body Fixers are rather like super-country doctors and are no strangers to traveling the wilderness. Although Body Fixers are idealistic healers, they aren't fools. They understand better than most people the dangers of Rifts Earth, and know sometimes one must kill or be killed. Fewer than 12% are dedicated pacifists who refuse to use a gun or fight back to protect themselves. On the contrary, many Body Fixers will not hesitate to use a weapon and threats to protect themselves and/or their patients. Considering the prejudice leveled at their nonhuman clients, Body Fixers are by nature rather stubborn, tenacious and militant, risking their lives every day for what they believe in. \n    Why do it? Why especially risk the retribution of the Coalition? Because Body Fixers are compassionate people who don't see much of a choice. Walk away and let someone they can save die, or do what they believe is right and save that life. Besides, half of all Body Fixers are D-Bees themselves devoted to helping all people. Person-al profit and power mean nothing to a dedicated Body Fixer. Most of them will offer their expert services to anybody who needs them for a hot meal, a dry place to sleep, and whatever seems like a fair and reasonable trade, all things considered. This has earned them the reputation for being kind and compassionate humanitarians and champions of the downtrodden. Some are practically living folk heroes.\n    Of course, not all Body Fixers are the soul of compassion. Some are quacks and brigands who charge an arm and a leg (sometimes, quite literally) for their services, and gouge those in need, especially D-Bees and fugitives wanted by the authorities. Burn outs, hacks and greedy, cold-hearted Fixers seem to be the embodiment of those employed at most Black Market Body-Chop-Shops. Some are downright evil. These callous and insensitive doctors are in it for the money. Only 1 in 10 Fixers at a Chop-Shop seem to genuinely care about their patients. If the money's right, they'll work on anybody. No questions asked. \n    Perhaps because they know and cherish the pure physical body so much, many Body Fixers refuse to use cybernetics on themselves, unless it is a lifesaving organ or prosthetic. They may also try to dissuade their patients from getting augmentation of any kind. On the other hand, about a third will get a handful of cybernetic enhancements, mainly optics and sensors. However, a solid 10% will get plenty of them, although again, limited mainly to optics, sensors and things that help them to be better doctors.\n\n(see Rifts® Ultimate Edition pg. 86 for more information)`;\n        this.image = 'assets/images/occ/BodyFixer.jpg';\n        this.raceDesc = `None; half are D-Bees.`;\n        this.reqIq = 10;\n        this.recommendedAttributes = `*( a high PP and MA are suggested but not mandatory. )`;\n        this.maBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.psBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.ppBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.peBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.perceptionBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.insanityBonus = { bonus: 3 };\n        this.diseaseBonus = { bonus: 3 };\n        this.dodgeBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.disarmBonus = { bonus: 1 };\n        this.poisonBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.drugsBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.horrorBonus = { bonus: 2 };\n        this.sdc = { sides: 6, amount: 1, bonus: 4 };\n        this.credits = { sides: 6, amount: 1, multiplier: 1000 };\n        this.blackMarketItems = { sides: 6, amount: 3, multiplier: 1000 };\n\n        this.occSkillsList = `Language: Native Tongue at 96%.\nLanguage: Other: Two of choice (+20%). \nLiteracy: Native Language (+30%; typically American). \nAthletics (General) or Body Building\nBasic Math (+15%)\nBiology (+30%)\nBrewing: Medicinal (+20%)\nChemistry (+20%)\nLore: D-Bees (+25%)\nMedical Doctor (+20%)\nOutdoorsmanship\nPathology (+30%)\nPilot: One of choice (+10%). \nSensory Equipment (+20% on medical, only +5% on all others). \nW.P.

Only the spell caster is immune.\n    Note: Percentile numbers are provided for random determination of a Time Flux as a random dimensional anomaly. This often occurs during ley line surges (ie. solstices, planetary alignments, etc.) and after Ley Line Storms (01 -33% chance).\n    01-50 Time seems to be moving too quickly while the character(s) seems to be moving in slow motion. What seems to be five minutes is really 10 or 15. Skill performance, duties, travel time/distance covered, and similar takes twice as long to do than it should. The character(s) affected will feel frustrated and behind schedule.\n    51-00 Time seems to be moving slowly while the character(s) seem to be moving quickly. What seems to be 10 or IS minutes is really only five. Skill performance, duties and travel time/distance travelled takes half the time they would normally. The character(s) affected will feel like a dynamo who is ahead of schedule.\n2. This spell can negate random Time Flux events as well as a Time Flux spell and its effects cast by a different mage.\n3. An alternative use of the Time Flux spell is \"Time Leap.\" The spell caster can use this incantation to leap forward (never backward) in time. The use of the Time Flux in this capacity will make the mage and one additional individual, animal or vehicle (no larger than a van; each person inside counts as one individual) per level of the spell caster's experience teleport into the future. The mage and his companions disappear from the here and now, to reappear several hours or days into the future (which becomes their here and now)! They always reappear at the same point where they leapt forward in time, and the entire process for the time travelers seems to take only a few seconds even if days have passed.\n    Unfortunately, by leapfrogging ahead in time, the time travelers have no knowledge of what has transpired while they were gone. Although only seconds have passed for them, the rest of the world continued to proceed as usual, with the natural passage of time and chain of events going forward. During this period, the time travelers seem to disappear from the face of the planet. Time leaping can be dangerous, because the future is a fluid and ever changing thing. Schedules may be altered and unexpected events can change plans and projections. Consequently, j umping ahead in time could mean missing a battle or event where the character(s) were desperately needed, or appearing in the middle of a conflict that they thought would have ended hours or days earlier. Similarly, events that the character(s) miss or avoid by Time Leaping may have a different outcome than expected because he (or they) were not present to make a difference.`;\n        this.note = `Leaping forward in time involves skipping time, not space, so this spell can not be used to teleport someplace else. The time travelers reappear at the same place on the ley line where they leapt forward in time to reappear there \"later.\" This spell only works when performed on a ley line, but once a Time Leap is completed the participants are free to physically leave the line and travel anywhere. If there is an obstruction at the exact location of departure, the time traveler(s) will appear at the nearest point to it (they do not materialize inside or under the obstruction).`;\n

This psychic inner self is the Astral Body, a whitish, transparent, ghostly image of the character's physical form. A long silver thread or cord connects the Astral Body with its physical self. If the cord is severed the character is likely to die of sudden shock as body and soul are torn asunder. There is only a 30% chance the Astral Self can locate its physical body without the silver umbilical cord (roll best 2 out of 3). \n    The physical body lapses into a coma-like trance when the Astral Self has left it. In this state the body is completely helpless. It cannot walk, move or think; completely catatonic. \n    The hazards are threefold. First, if the physical body is killed, the Astral Body is forever lost and will die, fade away, within six hours. Second, if the Astral Body gets lost or captured while in the Astral Plane. the body will begin to waste away and die. (Note: One minute of our time is equal to one week in the Astral Plane.) Third, the Astral Body is vulnerable to psychic attacks and attacks from ghosts, entities and creatures of the Astral Plane. \n    There are two levels of Astral Projection, coexistence (physical body and spirit form) in the material world and/or the Astral Plane (another dimension). Astral Projection from the physical body into the material world creates a ghostly specter of the Astral Self which can be seen only by other psychics, young children under 13 years old, animals and most supernatural creatures. While in Astral Form the character automatically gains the ability to float, fly (mach one/670 mph/1072 km maximum), see the invisible, pass through solid objects (including M DC walls), impervious to physical harm (including cold, heat and energy). are invisible to sensor systems and cameras, and see and hear as usual. The Astral Body cannot communicate with the physical world except through Telepathy or Empathy, nor speak to, smell or touch anything on the Material Plane. The Astral Self is little more than a mute, ghostly observer. Of course, this is a great way to locate invisible supernatural entities, as well as spy on other humans on the Mate-rial Plane (although limited by short sprints. See duration). A character traveling the Material Plane via Astral Projection may use any psionic powers that do NOT require physical contact. They can generally only affect the physical world (or themselves be affected from physical beings) by Sensitive psionic powers such as Telepathy, Clairvoyance, Empathy, etc.; Astral travelers communicate using Telepathy. \n    Traveling in Astral Form has its own very special dangers. While the character can see the invisible and other Astral Travelers, they can also see him. This makes him susceptible to their psychic and Astral Form attacks, for two Astral Travelers can lock into hand to hand combat as well. The most vulnerable target is the silver cord which is the Astral Traveler's lifeline to the physical world. Fortunately, the cord has an Astral S.D.C. which is two times that of the person's physical Hit Points and S.D.C. combined. The thread-like silver cord is a difficult target to hit; attackers are -6 to strike. The Astral Body also has an S.D.C. of two times the Hit Points and S.D.C. of the physical body combined. This means if the character has 18 Hit Points and 28 S.D.C. both the Astral Body and its silver cord have 92 Astral S.D.C. each (18 + 28 = 46 x 2 = 92 each). Remember, magic and psychic influence have full effect on the Astral Body. This includes exorcism, which will force the Astral Traveler to leave the immediate area (400 foot/122 m radius) and not return for 24 hours. The Astral Traveler has the same number of attacks per melee, bonuses, hand to hand, skills, knowledge and psychic powers that he or she has in the Material Plane.\n\n    Entering the Astral Plane is like entering the Twilight Zone. After a minute of concentration the Astral Gateway appears as a bright patch of shimmering, white light. Once the Astral Traveler passes through it, he will find himself in an endless expanse of white light, and rolling, white clouds. There is no up or down, no bottom or top; no north or south, no land or air or sea, just endless, slowly swirling white. Time, too, is a different or altered state, for what would seem to be a week in the Astral Plane is barely one minute in the physical world. That means a 2nd level Mind Melter could spend the equivalent of ten weeks in the Astral Plane and, when he returned to his physical body, he would find that only ten minutes of real time had elapsed. Although time may flow differently between the Astral Plane and the real world, the Astral Traveler is still subject to the laws of the real world when he returns. If he was low on I.S.P. when he entered the Astral Plane, even if he was there for several weeks of Astral Time, he would still be low on I.S.P. when he returns to the real world. Time and space twisted and distorted, the Astral Traveler can travel from one end of our planet to the other, in the blink of an eye, by hopping through the Astral Plane. However, if he does not know where he is going, he could end up hopelessly lost in the Astral Plane somewhere. Furthermore, the Astral Plane has its dangers as well, from Astral Beings and monsters to be-coming endlessly lost. Even if all goes well, the distortion of place and time makes it extremely difficult to find the material world and one's dormant, physical body. Even trying to follow the silver cord can lead to nowhere.\n\n    To return from the Astral Plane to the physical body, roll on the following table: Each roll will determine the Astral Traveler's state of mind and sense of direction. The percentile dice can be rolled up to three times per melee (15 seconds). The player must roll \"definitely certain\" to successfully return. The player may keep trying until he succeeds or time elapses. \n\nLocation of the Physical Body \nRoll Percentile Dice to Return from the Astral Plane:\n01%-30%: Hopelessly Lost (roll again). \n31%-50%: Uncertain, Confused (roll again). \n51%-76%: Fairly certain of location; on the right track (roll again). \n77%-00%: Definitely certain of location. (Whew! Made it Back).\n\n    Astral travel with a partner is a much safer way to travel, because if one can find his body, he can lead the other one out with him.`;\n        this.note = `Traveling on the Material Plane in Astral Form is infinitely easier than the Astral Plane. To find the physical body the character need only return to where he left it. If it has been moved or hidden the Astral Self can sense its location with a 60% efficiency (roll once per melee). \n    The other danger lies in being attacked by other beings in the Astral Plane. Entities and elemental creatures of magic live in the Astral Plane or travel through it. These beings are usually hostile, evil forces. While the Astral Body cannot touch or communicate with the material world, the Astral Body is quite solid to other inhabitants of the Astral Plane. The Astral Body is also vulnerable to magic and psychic powers, as well as physical assault by Astral Entities. \n    The energy which composes the Astral Plane is responsive to thoughts and desires. The strongest Astral Beings can mentally or magically control what a small area might look like. This means that the Astral Plane is made up of hundreds or perhaps thousands or even millions of tiny Astral \"Kingdoms\" adrift within the vast whiteness. Exactly what these kingdoms look like is up to the entity that creates it. Some may look like a modern city, others like castles or forests, while still others, a frightening landscape. Perhaps this is where legends of visitations to Heaven and Hell originate? It is always wise to avoid an Astral Kingdom, because only the most powerful Entities and Astral Beings can create and maintain them.\n`;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = AstralProjection;","const Spell = require('../Spell');\n\nclass Watchguard extends Spell {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.name = 'Watchguard   ';\n        this.group = 'Invocation';\n        this.level = 'Four';\n        this.range = `Six foot (1.2 m) radius per level of experience.`;\n        this.duration = `One hour per level of experience.`;\n        this.cost = `10 P.P.E.`;\n        this.savingThrow = `Special; -5 to save.`;\n        this.description = `    Watchguard sets up an invisible magic aura around a particular area (campsite, room, courtyard, etc.) that will instantly alert the spell caster should anything potentially dangerous or openly hostile come into the area (includes all predatory animals, robots, humanoids and supernatural beings).

This power is limited to the acquisition or reading of information only. The psychic cannot input, program, or delete data on the machine. He can also access information stored by most electronic means, including computer disks, video and audio disks, film or audio tape, and hard drives. Reading electronically encoded disks and tapes is similar to Object Read, except in this case, he hears and sees the data as if he were playing it on a computer or disk player, only he perceives the information IO times faster. Thus, the character can read (never input) information from disks or broken computers without a physical \"jack\" connection or an actual display device, i.e. computer and monitor, CD player, etc. \n    As an actual Machine Ghost, the psychic mentally enters and travels the neural network of an active computer. He is actually inside the de-vice. In many ways, this experience is similar to Astral Projection except the psychic is \"projecting\" into the machine rather than into the Astral Plane. It also has the same pitfalls as Astral Projection, as in the character enters a strange, very seemingly real world that he must learn to navigate. Like Astral Projection, the electronic world of computers takes on a virtual world landscape. This means in the computer virtual world, its programs, viruses and defense mechanisms will take on virtual manifestations that can interact, confront, impede, or attack the Machine Ghost. \n    A password or special access code may appear as a metal door or iron gate, or locked filing cabinet that needs to be (seemingly) broken open to gain access to what is held inside. The more difficult the code, the bigger, stronger and more difficult the door and lock(s). Data is likely to appear as books, paper files, diagrams, film, holograms, and other common means of communication and documentation. The more sophisticated defense measures are likely to appear as one or more guards who must be defeated before the information is accessible. They can appear as sorcerers, Coalition troops, known enemies or exotic aliens. Viruses and defenses designed to attack an intruder typically appear as demons or monsters. \n    Combat in the virtual world seems real and is conducted the same as it would happen in the real world. Combat and damage are measured by the character's perception of his real body armor, weapons and natural powers. When the psychic has lost more than 70% of his armor, or S.D.C./M.D.C., he will feel the urge to flee the virtual world. If he flees, a computer defender will not follow, however a virus will pursue and continue to fight. Although all such damage is only in the mind of the psychic (no physical damage occurs in the real world), if he dies in the virtual world, he can die in the real world as well! The shock to his psyche and body will momentarily stop his heart, and he slumps over dead! The character must roll to save vs coma and death. In this case, physical treatment is not necessary and the recovery process, if successful, takes less than a minute. The psychic must roll three times, and the best two out of three rolls determines life or death. Rolling between 01-75%, two out of three times, means the heart starts and the character is shaken but fine; feels woozy for 204 minutes (reduce Spd 25% and all combat bonuses by half). Failure to recover from the heart attack means immediate CPR medical treatment is required - Paramedic skill will suffice, provided any protective body armor can be removed so that treatment can be given; rescuers have IO minutes. Roll to save vs coma and death again; must roll twice under 80% out of three rolls. \n    The downside in the usage of this power is the psychic loses all sense of time and reality outside the data he is accessing. This means he is oblivious to what is happening around him, and unless protected by a companion, is vulnerable to attack without any means of defense. Pain or being struck or shaken will alert the psychic to trouble, but he has the choice of breaking contact and responding, or ignoring it and continuing to retrieve data. Only Telepathy can reach the character while in this state (can't hear spoken words or sounds outside the computer), and is a means of two-way communication. \n    A character accessing a file on a disk can break contact at any time with a thought. although he will be disoriented for one melee round; re-duce his number of attacks and combat bonuses by half. Breaking free of a computer virtual world is not so easy. \n    Unfortunately, leaving the virtual world of a computer is fundamentally the same as the Astral Plane. The psychic can vaguely sense the way he came and must follow it hack to the virtual access point. To do so. the player must roll on the following table and must roll \"definitely certain\" to have his character successfully escape. The player must keep trying until he succeeds or time elapses. If the character cannot es-cape virtual space before the duration of this ability elapses, he is flung out with the same effect as \"virtual death\"; roll to save vs coma and death as described above.`;\n        this.note = `The psychic will instinctively know when he's down to the last three minutes of the duration and when trying to exit, can fly toward the way out (typically appears as a door or a dimensional Rift).\n    01%-30%: Hopelessly lost (roll again). \n    31%-45%: Uncertain (roll again). \n    46%-65%: Fairly certain on the right track (roll again). 66%-00%: Definitely certain!

This is not a see aura, but an ability to actually see mystic energy waves. Furthermore, the Ley Line Walker can feel the presence of ley lines, pinpoint nexus areas, and tell when a Rift has opened nearby. \n    The pursuit of magic is a means to utilize natural energy and direct it with one's own force of will. The Ley Line Walker spends years learning to focus his thoughts and build his will in order to direct and mold mystic energy. He also spends years learning how to let the Iey line energy flow into and through him, building his tolerance for magic energy and making the Line Walker a sort of living relay station and energy transformer, as well as a P.P.E. battery. At these moments, the Line Walker becomes part of the energy he is directing and it gives him much greater control and range of magic abilities. \n    Ley Line Walkers are inquisitive and open to new ideas, people, and philosophies. Many are literate, study areas of science and have no aversion to using high-tech weapons, vehicles, and equipment. Light-weight weapons and armor are generally preferred because they are less cumbersome and do not interfere with the flow of magic energy (full body armor and bionics block and disrupt magic energy). \n    The traditional garb of the Ley Line Walker comes from the be-ginning of the Dark Age and always includes some kind of headgear and tunic to cover the head and part of the face, a hooded cloak or cape (very big into cloaks and capes), loose fitting robes, loincloth (worn over pants or robes) and/or ornate belt with inscribed strips of cloth or ornate jewelry dangling from the waist, walking boots, and a gas mask or air filter to cover the mouth.

At level one experience, players may select any three spells from each magic Level 1-4, for a total of 12 spells (three from each). Each additional level of experience, the character will be able to figure out/select one new spell equal to his own level of achievement/experience. So a 4th level Ley Line Walker can select one new spell from level four, or from levels one, two or three (not one from each).\n\nLearning New Spells\nAdditional spells and rituals of any magic level can be learned and or purchased at any time regardless of the character's experience level. See the Pursuit of Magic prior to the Spell Descriptions at the end of this Magic O.C.C. section. \n\nP.P.E.\nLike all practitioners of magic, the Ley Line Walker is a living battery of mystic energy. He draws upon that energy reserve to cast his spells and use magic. The Line Walker has the greatest amount of permanent P.P.E. of all mortal practitioners of magic. Permanent Base P.P.E.: 3D6x10+20 added to the character's P.E. attribute number to start. Plus an additional 3D6 P.P.E. per each additional level of experience starting at level two. \n\nSupplemental P.P.E.\nThe Ley Line Walker can also draw an extra 20 P.P.E. per melee round when on a ley line and 40 when at a ley lines nexus point! P.P.E. can also be stolen from living creatures and people by killing them (hence rituals involving human sacrifices) because their P.P.E. is doubled at the moment of death! However, a character of good or Unprincipled alignment would never do such a thing (except possibly under the most extreme circumstance). People can also willingly give up a portion of their P.P.E. but that's an unusual situation. It's all explained m the section entitled The Principles of Magic, page 185. \n\nP.P.E. Recovery\nFor the Ley Line Walker, spent P.P.E. recovers at a rate of seven points per hour of sleep or rest. Meditation restores P.P.E. at 15 per hour of meditation and is equal to one hour of sleep for this character when it comes to recovery from fatigue and physical rest.`;\n        this.equipmentDesc = `Robe or cape, set of clothing, set of traveling clothes, light M.D.C. body armor (seldom wear heavy armor, be-cause it reduces their speed and mobility by halt), knapsack, back-pack, ID4 small sacks, one large sack, six wooden stakes and mallet (for vampires and other practical applications), canteen, binoculars, tinted goggles or sunglasses, air filter and gas mask, flashlight, I 00 feet (30.5 m) of lightweight cord and grappling hook, pen or pencils and note or sketch pad. Ley Line Walkers like Techno-Wizard items and can use them well. \nWeapons will include a survival knife, hand axe, automatic pistol or submachine-gun (player's choice), energy pistol or rifle, and several extra clips of ammunition. \nThe vehicle of choice is usually a Techno-Wizardry device or hover vehicle or motorcycle or jet pack. They tend toward inexpensive and easy to replace items (or items they can carry, like a Wing Board), because they often have to leave their vehicle behind when traveling along ley lines (phasing).\n\nLey Line Walker Concealed Body Armor \nAlthough it is not usually visible, light to medium body armor is worn under the robes. The chest, shoulders, thighs and back of the head are always 'protected. M.D.C. plating is often used to cover the arms as vambraces ,and armored gauntlets, and the rest of the legs as well. Again, it is either concealed under the robes or loose, baggy clothing, or so stylish it looks like ornamental arm bracelets or vambraces rather than armor. The armor is often made from natural M.D.C. materials like the plates from a Fury Beetle or hide of a dinosaur, and interlaced with M.D. ceramic plates, padding and miracle fibers. M.D.C. metal alloys may be used but are kept to a minimum (less than 50%) because they interfere with the flow of P.P.E. and interfere with the ability to cast spells. Remember, the mage also has magic spells, such as Armor of Ithan, Impervious to Fire, etc., he can cast to provide additional protection for himself. (See page 188 for more on armor.) \n\nStats for Concealed Ley Line Walker Armor\nLight Armor Protection: 2D6+32 M.D.C. main body. Medium Armor: 3D6+50 M.D.C. main body; arms typically have 11-18 M.D.C., legs have 22-28 M.D.C.; -5% to Prowl, Climb, Swimming and other physical skills. Both are very common. Seldom wears heavy body armor. Heavy and full body armor are available in a variety of styles, but are seldom worn (maybe 10% wear them). For one, it's too bulky and uncomfortable, and for another, it's expensive, and lastly, unless it is made predominantly with 'natural materials, conventional environmental armor pre-vents spell casting. Techno-Wizard armor is one alternative for superior protection as well as a few non-magical alternatives, but Mage Armor always requires special consideration and construction to allow spell casting and the use of special abilities.`;\n        this.abilitiesDesc = `Sense Ley Line and Magic Energy\nThe Ley Line Walker can see and feel the presence of magic, providing all of the following sensing abilities as automatic powers which do not require the expenditure of P.P.E.\n• Sense Ley Line\nThe Ley Line Walker is able to feel whether there is a Iey line within the area of his sensing abilities, 10 miles (16 km) per level of experience. He can tell whether it is near or far and follow the feeling to the location of the Iey line. \nBase Skill: 30% +5% per each additional level of experience.\n• Sense Ley Line Nexus\nOnce the Iey line has been found, the walker can follow the Iey line to as many nexus points as it may have. A nexus point is where two or more ley lines cross/intersect. \nBase Skill: 40% +5% per each additional level of experience.\n• Sense a Rift\nThe mage will automatically feel the sensation of a Rift opening or closing anywhere within 50 miles (80 km) of him. Increase the sensing range 10 miles (16 km) per each additional level of experience starting with level two. Although he cannot tell exactly where this Rift is, the mage knows if it is near or far and whether it is big or small. Note: When actually on a ley line, the Line Walker will know exactly where the Rift is located and he can sense one wherever it is, as long as it is on the ley line or a connecting line. \n• Sense Magic in Use\nThe expenditure of magic in the form of a spell, Rifting, or Techno-Wizardry can be felt, if not seen, up to 100 feet (30.5 m) away per every level of the Line Walker's experience. The Ley Line Walker will not know the location nor be able to trace it, but he will feel its energy and know that magic is being used in the area of his sensing range. Note: This does not include the use of psionic powers. \n• See Magic Energy\nThe mage sees magic energy/P.P.E. radiating from people, creatures, objects, and areas, as a faint aura whenever more than 20 P.P.E. points are present. The sensing ability is so acute that the Ley Line Walker can see things made invisible by magic and invisible things that are magical, including invisible dragons and other creatures of magic. This special sight occurs only when the mage de-sires to use it and focuses on seeing the magically invisible. However, the effort uses up one melee attack/action per round (15 seconds) that this special sight is willed in place. Note: Does not work on the spell, Invisibility Superior. Range: Line of sight, about I 000 feet (305 m). \n\nRead Ley Lines\nThis power instills the mage with instant information about the ley line in a matter of moments. The Ley Line Walker will know the following: What directions the ley line runs (and therefore, his location on it; north, south, east, west, etc.), how long the line runs, whether there are any nexus points and where, and whether there are any Rifts presently open along the line. The character also knows about any major natural disasters currently happening along the line, such as a forest fire, flooding, hurricane, or earthquake. War and magic are not natural disasters. The power is automatic and does not require the expenditure of personal P.P.E. \n\nLey Line Transmission\nA Ley Line Walker can send a verbal and/or visual message directly along a ley line to another person so long as that person is located somewhere on the line. The best messages are brief ones of under a hundred words to avoid overwhelming the recipient. Unfortunately, the message is a one way transmission un-less the other person is also a Line Walker or other mage with the Transmission spell. Range is limited only by the length of the ley line and the people's position on the line. The time lapse between sending and receiving a ley line transmission is only a matter of seconds. The message can be sent to one specific person or several people (one per-son per level of the sender's experience), or several people at different locations on the line.\nThe only danger is that a telepathic individual (psionic or magic) may be able to listen in on the message. There is a 01-20% chance that any psionic or magic character with Telepathy will sense a Ley Line Transmission coming through, and eavesdrop (01-31 % chance that they too can receive the message). There is no way for the sender to know if others have eavesdropped on his message. Nor is there any way to scramble the message. This power is an automatic ability for the Ley Line Walker and does not require the expenditure of personal P.P.E. \n\nLey Line Phasing (teleportation)\nA Ley Line Walker also has the power to instantly teleport from one place to another, FLAWLESSLY anywhere on the same ley line. By the way, that can be any-where in any direction (ley lines can be a quarter/0.4 km to one full mile/1.6 km wide!), including up into the air (ley lines are typically a half mile/0.8 km to two miles/3.2 km tall) and hang there because Line Walkers can walk a ley line, as in walk floating above the ground. If he teleports up into the air he can stay there suspended (+20% to Prowl/ hide, because us ground dwelling humans don't usually look up). To do a Ley Line Teleport the mage must concentrate, opening himself to the ley line energy and focusing all of his thoughts to the task of teleporting to the new location. Engaging in conversation or combat, even self-defense, will break the concentration, forcing the mage to start over. The process requires ID4 melees (15 to 60 seconds) of concentration every time before the teleportation happens, so he can't just pop out in a heartbeat, but it's still very, very handy. The teleport is always on target, because the Ley Line Walker is one with the ley line. Of course, unless he can see his destination, he can't know who or what might also be present in that area and he could appear in the middle of an armed camp (but not inside one of them or a tree, etc., as is the dan-ger with the Teleportation spell). \nNote; Ley Line Phasing is an automatic ability common to all Ley Line Walkers at NO P.P.E. cost, but it does take its toll on the body. The maximum number of phasings/teleports possible is four per hour. The per 24 hour period is 4 +2 per each level of experience (6 at level one, 8 at level two, IO at level three, etc). More than this is just impossible. The only other limitations are: 1) He can only teleport himself and his possessions, nobody else. 2) The location must be along the same ley line as if traveling on a mystic railway. To switch to a different ley line, the character must travel or teleport to the nexus point intersection •where two or more different ley lines cross paths to follow one of the other lines.\n\nLey' Line Walking or Line Drifting\nA Ley Line Walker can open himself to the ley line energies and walk or float through the air along the length of the ley line. The speed factor is a mere Speed of 10, but is relaxing and requires absolutely no exertion or even physical movement1 of the feet or body if drifting afloat. NO P.P.E. is necessary for Ley Line Walker to do this, because he's drawing on the ambient energy of the line and his attunement to ley line energy make him practically a living part of the line itself. Note: He can even meditate while drifting down a ley line. Height is typically 1-5 feet (0.3 to 1.5 m) above the ground, but if he concentrates he can reach a height as great as the line itself. This is dangerous, however, as it leaves him out in the open easy to see from a great distance. Just below or just above treetop level is common among those who like to be high above the ground. \n\nLey Line Rejuvenation\nThe character can absorb ley line energy to double the rate of natural healing. To do this, the mage must concentrate and relax on a ley line, letting the mystic energy fill him and heal him over a period of days. The mage can also perform an instant rejuvenation on a ley line as often as once every 24 hours, in which after about ten minutes of concentration, he is completely rested, alert, and healed of 20 Hit Points and 20 S.D.C. + ID6 additional Hit Points and 2D6 S.D.C. (or 4D6 M.D.C. if a Mega-Damage being) per level of experience! Again at no P.P.E. cost, but only possible on a ley line. Note: No P.P.E. or I.S.P. can be restored this way, only Hit Points and S.D.C.\n\nLey Line Observation Ball\nA globe of light, about the size of a soccer ball, can be conjured out of thin air and linked to the Ley Line Walker like a third eye. The sphere of blue or white light can be directed by its creator to zoom ahead or behind him like a remote control spy device or familiar. Everything that the ball sees and hears is instantly transmitted to its maker. The sphere will remain in existence as long as the Ley Line Walker stays within the ley line, or until he dispels it, or until it is destroyed. \nStats for a typical Observation Ball\nM.D.C.: One point per level of its creator. \nRange: Up to 500 feet (152 m) away from its creator per level of its creator, so a fifth level Ley Line Walker could send his Observation Ball 2500 feet away and a tenth level mage almost one mile (1.6 km). \nSpeed: Up to Spd 44 (30 mph/48 km). \nBonuses: + 3 to dodge. It has no offensive capabilities other than to buzz onlookers and possibly startle them (not likely). Actions of that sort, however, require the Ley Line Walker to have line of sight on the ball for him to direct it men-tally, each attack/action of the ball counting as one of his own melee actions/attacks. \n\nAffinity with Rift & Ley Line Magic\nThe Spell Invocations known as Rift & Ley Line Magic are most commonly known by the Ley Line Walker O.C.C These spells common to the Ley Line Walker and although these spells can be important to the profession, the Ley Line \nWalker does not start with any at level one (unless a Ley Line Rifter O.C.C.). They are usually acquired over time. \nThe Rift & Ley Line Magic spells are: Dimensional Portal (1000), Ley Line Fade (20), Ley Line Ghost (80 or 240), Ley Line Phantom (40), Ley Line Restoration (80o+), Ley Line Resurrection (2000+), Ley Line Shutdown (3000), Ley Line Storm Defense (180), Ley Line Tendril Bolts (26), Ley Line Time Capsule (15), Ley Line Time Flux (80), Ley Line Transmission (30), Rift to Limbo (160), Rift Teleportation (200), Rift Triangular Defense System (840), Summon Ley Line Storm (500), Swallowing Rift (300). \nLearning them\nThese spells can be learned by being taught by an elder mage or by communing with the ley line. This can occur upon reaching a new mystic plateau (new level of experience), in which the character goes off onto a ley line allow and goes into a meditative trance that last 48 hours. At the end of the trance he knows one of these spells (pick one). \nThere are two schools of thoughts about Rift & Ley line Magic. One is the typical Line Walker who feel Ley Line Magic is useful, but no more important or significant than any other spell invocation. And the smaller camp who feel Ley Line Magic is of significant and over-riding value. This second camp tends to be a silent minority, for they consider themselves to be elitists with unique and keen insights and whose focus make them special. These mages are Ley Line Rifters who focus on learning all the spells above and similar energy and dimension types of Invocations (described immediately after the Ley Line Walker O.C.C.). This focus on ley lines and dimension magic makes them, in effect, specialists in Rift and Ley Line Magic. A mastery of magic and knowledge that these mages see as a strength and that most Ley Line Walkers and other practitioners of magic regard as short-sighted and limiting.\n\nLey Line Force Field\nThe Ley Line Walker can also put in place an energy field reminiscent of the Armor of Ithan around himself whenever he's on a ley line. This extra bit of protection provides 20 M.D.C. +2 M.D.C. per level of its creator's experience. It costs the mage 10 P.P.E. to create/summon it initially, but once it is in place it remains up for the entire time he remains on the ley line or until he dispels it. If the Ley Line Force Field is destroyed, it will regenerate at full strength at the start of the next melee round! \nNote: Having the force field up and in place draws upon half the ambient P.P.E. of the ley line normally available (20 P.P.E.) to the Ley Line Walker per melee round. Energy the mage often draws upon to supplement his own spell casting. This could be a problem in a combat situation and require the character to drop his protective field to tap more energy.`;\n        this.alignment = `Any.`;\n        this.startingHandToHand =

He can tell whether it is near or far and follow the feeling to the location of the Iey line. \nBase Skill: 30% +5% per each additional level of experience.\n\n• Sense Ley Line Nexus\nOnce the Iey line has been found, the walker can follow the Iey line to as many nexus points as it may have. A nexus point is where two or more ley lines cross/intersect. \nBase Skill: 40% +5% per each additional level of experience.\n\n• Sense a Rift\nThe mage will automatically feel the sensation of a Rift opening or closing anywhere within 50 miles (80 km) of him. Increase the sensing range 10 miles (16 km) per each additional level of experience starting with level two. Although he cannot tell exactly where this Rift is, the mage knows if it is near or far and whether it is big or small. Note: When actually on a ley line, the Line Walker will know exactly where the Rift is located and he can sense one wherever it is, as long as it is on the ley line or a connecting line. \n\n• Sense Magic in Use\nThe expenditure of magic in the form of a spell, Rifting, or Techno-Wizardry can be felt, if not seen, up to 100 feet (30.5 m) away per every level of the Line Walker's experience. The Ley Line Walker will not know the location nor be able to trace it, but he will feel its energy and know that magic is being used in the area of his sensing range.

The sensing ability is so acute that the Ley Line Walker can see things made invisible by magic and invisible things that are magical, including invisible dragons and other creatures of magic. This special sight occurs only when the mage de-sires to use it and focuses on seeing the magically invisible.

If he teleports up into the air he can stay there suspended (+20% to Prowl/ hide, because us ground dwelling humans don't usually look up). To do a Ley Line Teleport the mage must concentrate, opening himself to the ley line energy and focusing all of his thoughts to the task of teleporting to the new location. Engaging in conversation or combat, even self-defense, will break the concentration, forcing the mage to start over. The process requires ID4 melees (15 to 60 seconds) of concentration every time before the teleportation happens, so he can't just pop out in a heartbeat, but it's still very, very handy. The teleport is always on target, because the Ley Line Walker is one with the ley line. Of course, unless he can see his destination, he can't know who or what might also be present in that area and he could appear in the middle of an armed camp (but not inside one of them or a tree, etc., as is the dan-ger with the Teleportation spell).`,\n                note: `Ley Line Phasing is an automatic ability common to all Ley Line Walkers at NO P.P.E. cost, but it does take its toll on the body.

One is the typical Line Walker who feel Ley Line Magic is useful, but no more important or significant than any other spell invocation. And the smaller camp who feel Ley Line Magic is of significant and over-riding value. This second camp tends to be a silent minority, for they consider themselves to be elitists with unique and keen insights and whose focus make them special. These mages are Ley Line Rifters who focus on learning all the spells above and similar energy and dimension types of Invocations (described immediately after the Ley Line Walker O.C.C.).

Phase World ( or any of the worlds in the Three Galaxies), any of the worlds in Skraypers, the Realm of Demons or Gargoyles, the Palladium Fantasy World, Heroes Unlimited World, etc. Mega-Damage characters, spells, powers and weapons who enter an S.D.C. environment turn into S.D.C. equivalents.`;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = PlaneSkip;","const StatValue = require('./StatValue')\n\n// also make changes in OCC and Race\nclass Saves {\n    constructor(\n        poison = new StatValue,\n        insanity = new StatValue,\n        spell = new StatValue,\n        pain = new StatValue,\n        disease = new StatValue,\n        drugs = new StatValue,\n        ritual = new StatValue,\n        possession = new StatValue,\n        psionic = new StatValue,\n        magic = new StatValue,\n        toxin = new StatValue,\n        coma = new StatValue,\n        death = new StatValue,\n        horror = new StatValue,\n        illusion = new StatValue,\n        mindControl = new StatValue,\n        fatigue = new StatValue,\n        curse = new StatValue\n    ) {\n        this.poison = poison;\n        this.poison.name = 'Poison';\n        this.insanity = insanity;\n        this.insanity.name = 'Insanity';\n        this.spell = spell;\n        this.spell.name = 'Spell';\n        this.pain = pain;\n        this.pain.name = 'Pain';\n        this.disease = disease;\n        this.disease.name = 'Disease';\n        this.drugs = drugs;\n        this.drugs.name = 'Drugs';\n        this.ritual = ritual;\n        this.ritual.name = 'Ritual';\n        this.possession = possession;\n        this.possession.name = 'Possession';\n        this.psionic = psionic;\n        this.psionic.name = 'Psionic';\n        this.magic = magic;\n        this.magic.name = 'Magic';\n        this.toxin = toxin;\n        this.toxin.name = 'Toxin';\n        this.coma = coma;\n        this.coma.name = 'Coma';\n        this.death = death;\n        this.death.name = 'Death';\n        this.horror = horror;\n        this.horror.name = 'Horror';\n        this.illusion = illusion;\n        this.illusion.name = 'Illusion';\n        this.mindControl = mindControl;\n        this.mindControl.name = 'Mind Control';\n        this.fatigue = fatigue;\n        this.fatigue.name = 'Fatigue';\n        this.curse = curse;\n        this.curse.name = 'Curses';\n    }\n\n    getPoison() {\n        return this.poison;\n    }\n\n    getInsanity() {\n        return this.insanity;\n    }\n\n    getSpell() {\n        return this.spell;\n    }\n\n    getPain() {\n        return this.pain;\n    }\n\n    getDisease() {\n        return this.disease;\n    }\n\n    getDrugs() {\n        return this.drugs;\n    }\n\n    getRitual() {\n        return this.ritual;\n    }\n\n    getPossession() {\n        return this.possession;\n    }\n\n    getPsionic() {\n        return this.psionic;\n    }\n\n    getMagic() {\n        return this.magic;\n    }\n\n    getToxin() {\n        return this.toxin;\n    }\n\n    getComa() {\n        return this.coma;\n    }\n\n    getDeath() {\n        return this.death;\n    }\n\n    getHorror() {\n        return this.horror;\n    }\n\n    getIllusion() {\n        return this.illusion;\n    }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Saves;"],"sourceRoot":""}
