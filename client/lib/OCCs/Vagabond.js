        this.description = `    Not everybody who gets involved in adventure is a specialist in combat or some other area of training. Some are just ordinary people who get swept up in the flow of events or decide that it is time they make a change in their Jives. Others are individuals who possess some natural power (psionics or racial ability), but do not have great training or education other than in the use of their powers. These folks tend to take low-end jobs or drift from place to place, and job to job. Vagabonds are the ultimate Bohemians of this group. They actually like the freedom of not being tied down and drifting along from one adventure to the next. They put their trust in fate and make the best of every situation. Vagabonds are laid-back, easygoing and friendly. They like to travel, like meeting new people, like trying new things (even if it's baling hay or chopping wood), and like not having to worry about supporting a family or answering to anybody but themselves. For a Vagabond, each new face is a welcomed encounter, each new place an opportunity for adventure, even if it's on a small, personal scale. "See, I didn't know that," and "oh, how interesting," are words anyone traveling with a Vagabond is likely to hear over and over again. 
    Those who choose the life of a Vagabond are usually spirited individuals full of life and curiosity, but rarely very educated in any formal sense, nor literate, and seldom seek higher education. They tend to live by the seat of their pants and rely on their wits, luck, and the kindness of strangers. Many nomads, wilderness folk, peasants, farmers, Major psychics and mutants are Vagabonds.
