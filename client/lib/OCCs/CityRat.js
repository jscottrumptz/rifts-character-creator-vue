    City Rats are the denizens of the 'Burbs and big cities. In the fortress cities modeled after Chi-Town, those who live in the lower levels of such a metropolis are generally nicknamed "Downsiders," but "City Rat" is a designation for a Downsider troublemaker and the street urchins who run amok in the 'Burbs. They exist in most urban environments, but absolutely thrive in the ' Burbs and the lower levels, tunnels, and sewers of Chi-Town, Iron Heart and other mega-cities of the Coalition States, the New German Republic, Mexico and Japan. Most have never been beyond the city limits and have no desire to go adventuring beyond the urban sprawl. These are "city people" through and through. They know little about the outside world except what they read or hear on the street, and view it as wondrous, scary, and alien, but most of all, a place not for them. Their world is the rumbling and bustling city streets. Their secret havens, hideouts and lairs are the shadowy dark places that other city dwellers have forgotten about or fear to enter. 
    City Rats love the acrid mix of smells that is the living city: machine oil, vehicle exhaust, booze, and perspiration of the thronging multitudes. They are not afraid of the city's dark comers or its vermin. They know the back streets and, often, the alleys, sewer systems, and access tunnels in the belly of the beast that is the city. And they know them better than the average citizen knows the highways and avenues. 
    City Rats pride themselves on their knowledge of the streets and the movers and shakers who work them and the predators that prowl them. That means City Rats know where to find contraband, cybernetics, drugs, pawnshops, fences, Body-Chop-Shops, Black Market hangouts and hoods, the best food, the cheapest women, all night hot spots, and other places, resources and commodities on the streets. If you know where to look, you can find most anything you could need or want, and City Rats know all the ins and outs of their city. 
    The career of a City Rat is a way of life rather than an occupation. A lifestyle glamorized (and lived) as a sort of swashbuckling streetwise hacker and petty crook who travels the undercurrents of the city streets and the electronic super-highway with equal ease. It is a life of self-made intrigue, exploration, spying and thievery (of data if nothing else). City Rats are usually young men and women in their teens or twenties who walk on the wild side. They crave adventure and find it by bucking the system and dodging the law. A City Rat may be an idealistic rebel who seeks reform and justice in a corrupt and unjust society, or a simple thrill seeker who finds excitement and romance in the dark underbelly of the city and the subculture of the street scene. Many City Rats are computer hackers and information brokers, while others are little more than beggars and thieves, all surviving by the seat of their pants. The individual 's exact orientation and skills typically reflect his alignment, ideals, ethics, and goals.`
