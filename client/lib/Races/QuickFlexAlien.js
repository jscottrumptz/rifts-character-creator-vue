        this.description = `    The Quick-Flex Alien is the classic D-Bee who, at a quick glance, couId pass for human. They don't look that different at all, same body shape, skin color, hair and general attractiveness. 
    A longer look, however, shows that the character has large eyes, a bit longer face and pinholes for a nose. Clad in armor and helmet or face covering and one would never know the difference between him, a human and a dozen other bipedal humanoids. But there are other, less obvious differences. Quick-Flex Aliens are double-jointed, ambidextrous, have lightning reflexes, and have a much higher metabolism than humans. That means they are always thin, a bit on the small side (rarely exceed five feet, 10 inches/1.75 m), are alert, agile and incredibly fast. Their re-flexes and speed are roughly equal to a Juicer or Crazy, which makes Quick-Flex Aliens superb gunmen, gunslingers, snipers, assassins, thieves, pilots and acrobats. They love adventure and fast moving vehicles. They also like adorning themselves with tattoos on their arms and chest. 
    Quick-Flex Aliens are always a welcomed addition among mercenaries, soldiers, gunfighters, lawmen, pilots, and mechanics. Their skill at piloting vehicles is almost as good as their skill with guns and thrown weapons.

Robot Pilot is acceptable, but most Quick-Flex Aliens feel too removed from the action locked inside a walking tank. On the other hand, a Soldier, Mere, bandit, or Vagabond whose area of specialty is piloting fast vehicles (cars, motorcycles, hovercycles, rocket bikes, jet packs, etc.) is something this D-Bee would enjoy.
